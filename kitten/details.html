<p>
<img src="18247t.jpg"><br><b>18247</b> - 2 Lithium Polymer cells from Dynamic Web Enterprises weigh just 6.2 grams total.  The razor blade is for size reference.

<p>
<img src="18255t.jpg"><br><b>18255</b> - 2 Lithium Polymer cells with Bob Selman's charger.  The Selman charger will recharge just one cell at a time, hence the individual connectors.

<p>
<img src="18253t.jpg"><br><b>18253</b> - I made up a simple harness to connect the Li Poly cells in series.

<p>
<img src="18250t.jpg"><br><b>18250</b> - I made up a simple harness to connect the Li Poly cells in series.

<p>
<img src="18251t.jpg"><br><b>18251</b> - The Li Poly cells are shown with the 6x50mAh nicad pack for size reference.  At less than half the weight, and 3 times the flight duration of nicads, the Li Poly's are a perfect match for the Kitten.  The extra weight of Nicads does help smooth out rougher air, and they are less delicate in operation.  Both types work well.


<p>
<img src="18553t.jpg"><br><b>18553</b> - The Potensky charger shown here, available from Wild R/C, will charge multi cell Li Poly packs.  If I had this charger while initially testing the Kitten, I could have removed about 2 more grams of wiring.

<p>
<img src="18555t.jpg"><br><b>18555</b> - The Potensky charger available from Wild R/C has two sets of switches to match the charger to the battery being charged.
<p>
<img src="18557t.jpg"><br><b>18557</b> - These two coiled antennas from E Cubed R/C are perfect matches for models like the Kitten.  Trailing a long antenna really spoils the ilusion of a nice scale model in the air.  The longer is 4" in length.

<p>
<img src="18061t.jpg"><br><b>18061</b> - The balsa tailwheel is non steering.  The carbon fiber pushrods are attached to the 1/64" ply control horns with .020 music wire z-bends.

<p>
<img src="18063t.jpg"><br><b>18063</b> - The balsa tailwheel is non steering.  The carbon fiber pushrods are attached to the 1/64" ply control horns with .020 music wire z-bends.

<p>
<img src="18058t.jpg"><br><b>18058</b> - A large belly hatch provides immediate access to the radio and battery.

<p>
<img src="18064t.jpg"><br><b>18064</b> - With the hatch opened, you can clearly see the 1/16" balsa tray for the radio and battery.  The Skyhooks and Rigging Hybrid rx is tucked in behind the cockpit at the right.

<p>
<img src="18263t.jpg"><br><b>18263</b> - The 5:1 geared N-20 6volt motor fits perfectly in the nose of the Kitten.  A few dabs of IC-2000 from Bob Smith Industries hold it in place.  The cross member was added after installing the motor to support the exhaust pipe detail.
