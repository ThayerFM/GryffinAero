<img src="18178t.jpg"><br><b>18178</b> - The Foremost Miter Cut is one of the handiest tools for stick and stringer type construction.
<p>
<img src="18150t.jpg"><br><b>18150</b> - I framed the horizontal tail surfaces from the inside out.
<p>
<img src="18153t.jpg"><br><b>18153</b> - A straight edge and a razor blade will help quickly trim the ribs to length.
<p>
<img src="18155t.jpg"><br><A NAME="18160"></A>
<b>18155</b> - All the ribs are trimmed to length.  Now I just need to add the outlines and gussets.

<p>
<img src="18160t.jpg"><br><b>18160</b> - Here I have completed the structure and sanded it smooth.
<p>
<img src="18162t.jpg"><br><b>18162</b> - It took longer to write about the tail surfaces than to build them!
<p>
<img src="18169t.jpg"><br><b>18169</b> - The fuselage sides are built much the same way as the tail.  First lay down the top longeron, and cut a bunch of uprights a bit longer than necessary.
<p>
<img src="18163t.jpg"><br><b>18163</b> - Here I have glued the uprights to the top longeron.
<p>
<img src="18164t.jpg"><br><b>18164</b> - With the uprights trimmed to length, it is time to add the diagonal bracing and the nose sheeting.
<p>
<img src="18166t.jpg"><br><b>18166</b> - Adding the nose sheeting and diagonals takes just a moment, and has the fuse side almost completed.
<p>
<img src="18168t.jpg"><br><b>18168</b> -    The first fuselage side was done in less than 10 minutes, now on to #2.  Be careful to shim the nose sheeting to be flush with the face of one of the fuse sides so you have both a left and a right.
<p>
<img src="18170t.jpg"><br><b>18170</b> - The total time to frame up both of these fuselage sides, and photograph them along the way, was less than 20 minutes.
<p>
<img src="18171t.jpg"><br><b>18171</b> - Basic stick and stringer parts, built with a slight twist.  I find working from the inside out to be very fast and easy.
<p>
<img src="15434t.jpg"><br><B>15434</B> - Light 1/8" balsa laminated cross grain forms the rough blanks for the wheels. Lengths of 1/16" aluminum tubing will become the hubs.
<p>
<img src="15435t.jpg"><br><B>15435</B> - Light 1/8" balsa laminated cross grain forms the rough blanks for the wheels. 1/16" aluminum tubing for the hubs is long enough to hold in a drill chuck.
<p>
<img src="15437t.jpg"><br><B>15437</B> - I cut off the corners of the square blanks, then use a slow speed hand drill for turning the rough wheel blanks.  A sanding drum in a Dremel tool will quickly shape the wheels.
<p>
<img src="15442t.jpg"><br><B>15442</B> - A raw blank is shown here with a rough turned wheel.  Only a few moments is needed to round off the original blank.
<p>
<img src="15443t.jpg"><br><B>15443</B> - Here are the finished wheels, ready for finishing.  Note that I recessed the area around the hubs a bit to leave room to secure the wheels on the axles.
