<tr><td>

<img src="18178t.jpg"><br><b>18178</b> - The Foremost Miter Cut is one of the handiest tools for stick and stringer type construction.
<p>
<img src="18150t.jpg"><br><b>18150</b> - I framed the horizontal tail surfaces from the inside out.
<p>
<img src="18153t.jpg"><br><b>18153</b> - A straight edge and a razor blade will help quickly trim the ribs to length.
<p>
<img src="18155t.jpg"><br><b>18155</b> - All the ribs are trimmed to length.  Now I just need to add the outlines and gussets.
<p>
<img src="18160t.jpg"><br><b>18160</b> - Here I have completed the structure and sanded it smooth.
<p>
<img src="18162t.jpg"><br><b>18162</b> - It took longer to write about the tail surfaces than to build them!
<p>
<img src="18169t.jpg"><br><b>18169</b> - The fuselage sides are built much the same way as the tail.  First lay down the top longeron, and cut a bunch of uprights a bit longer than necessary.
<p>
<img src="18163t.jpg"><br><b>18163</b> - Here I have glued the uprights to the top longeron.
<p>
<img src="18164t.jpg"><br><b>18164</b> - With the uprights trimmed to length, it is time to add the diagonal bracing and the nose sheeting.
<p>
<img src="18166t.jpg"><br><b>18166</b> - Adding the nose sheeting and diagonals takes just a moment, and has the fuse side almost completed.
<p>
<img src="18168t.jpg"><br><b>18168</b> -    The first fuselage side was done in less than 10 minutes, now on to #2.  Be careful to shim the nose sheeting to be flush with the face of one of the fuse sides so you have both a left and a right.
<p>
<img src="18170t.jpg"><br><b>18170</b> - The total time to frame up both of these fuselage sides, and photograph them along the way, was less than 20 minutes.
<p>
<img src="18171t.jpg"><br><b>18171</b> - Basic stick and stringer parts, built with a slight twist.  I find working from the inside out to be very fast and easy.
<p>
<img src="15434t.jpg"><br><B>15434</B> - Light 1/8" balsa laminated cross grain forms the rough blanks for the wheels. Lengths of 1/16" aluminum tubing will become the hubs.
<p>
<img src="15435t.jpg"><br><B>15435</B> - Light 1/8" balsa laminated cross grain forms the rough blanks for the wheels. 1/16" aluminum tubing for the hubs is long enough to hold in a drill chuck.
<p>
<img src="15437t.jpg"><br><B>15437</B> - I cut off the corners of the square blanks, then use a slow speed hand drill for turning the rough wheel blanks.  A sanding drum in a Dremel tool will quickly shape the wheels.
<p>
<img src="15442t.jpg"><br><B>15442</B> - A raw blank is shown here with a rough turned wheel.  Only a few moments is needed to round off the original blank.
<p>
<img src="15443t.jpg"><br><B>15443</B> - Here are the finished wheels, ready for finishing.  Note that I recessed the area around the hubs a bit to leave room to secure the wheels on the axles.

<p>
<img src="15445t.jpg"><br><b>15445</b> - Test fitting the wheels.  The axles will be trimmed to length on final assembly.

<p>
<img src="15840t.jpg"><br><b>15840</b> - The bare framework of my J-3 Kitten prototype.  The wing was built up of cracked ribs, to speed construction.

<p>
<img src="15857t.jpg"><br><b>15857</b> - The bare framework of my J-3 Kitten prototype.  The wheels could be made of foam to save a little weight.

<p>
<img src="15844t.jpg"><br><b>15844</b> - The large tail surfaces that provide stability are clearly apparent in this view.

<H2>J-3 Kitten Completed</H2>
<p>
<table width=500>
<tr><td>
<img src="18040t.jpg"><br><b>18040</b> - The J-3 Kitten is just unique enough to stand out from the crowd.

<p>
<img src="18050t.jpg"><br><b>18050</b> - The J-3 Kitten is just unique enough to stand out from the crowd.

<p>
<img src="18041t.jpg"><br><b>18041</b> - Even a simple paper panel invites the modeler to "climb aboard" for a quick flight. The fuselage decals were laser printed onto clear label stock.

<p>
<img src="18042t.jpg"><br><b>18042</b> - Even a simple paper panel invites the modeler to "climb aboard" for a quick flight. The fuselage decals were laser printed onto clear label stock.

<p>
<img src="18043t.jpg"><br><b>18043</b> - Even a simple paper panel invites the modeler to "climb aboard" for a quick flight. The fuselage decals were laser printed onto clear label stock.

<p>
<img src="18048t.jpg"><br><b>18048</b> - The simple lines of the Kitten are easily seen in this side view.

<p>
<img src="18057t.jpg"><br><b>18057</b> - The exhaust pipe and muffler were carved from light balsa and add a lot of personality to the Kitten.

<H2>J-3 Kitten Details</H2>
<p>
<table width=500>
<tr><td>

<p>
<img src="18247t.jpg"><br><b>18247</b> - 2 Lithium Polymer cells from Dynamic Web Enterprises weigh just 6.2 grams total.  The razor blade is for size reference.

<p>
<img src="18255t.jpg"><br><b>18255</b> - 2 Lithium Polymer cells with Bob Selman's charger.  The Selman charger will recharge just one cell at a time, hence the individual connectors.

<p>
<img src="18253t.jpg"><br><b>18253</b> - I made up a simple harness to connect the Li Poly cells in series.

<p>
<img src="18250t.jpg"><br><b>18250</b> - I made up a simple harness to connect the Li Poly cells in series.

<p>
<img src="18251t.jpg"><br><b>18251</b> - The Li Poly cells are shown with the 6x50mAh nicad pack for size reference.  At less than half the weight, and 3 times the flight duration of nicads, the Li Poly's are a perfect match for the Kitten.  The extra weight of Nicads does help smooth out rougher air, and they are less delicate in operation.  Both types work well.


<p>
<img src="18553t.jpg"><br><b>18553</b> - The Potensky charger shown here will charge multi cell Li Poly packs.  If I had this charger while initially testing the Kitten, I could have removed about 2 more grams of wiring.

<p>
<img src="18555t.jpg"><br><b>18555</b> - The Potensky charger has two sets of switches to match the charger to the battery being charged.
<p>
<img src="18557t.jpg"><br><b>18557</b> - These two coiled antennas from E Cubed R/C are perfect matches for models like the Kitten.  Trailing a long antenna really spoils the ilusion of a nice scale model in the air.  The longer is 4" in length.

<p>
<img src="18061t.jpg"><br><b>18061</b> - The balsa tailwheel is non steering.  The carbon fiber pushrods are attached to the 1/64" ply control horns with .020 music wire z-bends.

<p>
<img src="18063t.jpg"><br><b>18063</b> - The balsa tailwheel is non steering.  The carbon fiber pushrods are attached to the 1/64" ply control horns with .020 music wire z-bends.

<p>
<img src="18058t.jpg"><br><b>18058</b> - A large belly hatch provides immediate access to the radio and battery.

<p>
<img src="18064t.jpg"><br><b>18064</b> - With the hatch opened, you can clearly see the 1/16" balsa tray for the radio and battery.  The Skyhooks and Rigging Hybrid rx is tucked in behind the cockpit at the right. The batteries mount on a tab of velcro, not shown, just ahead of the servos.

<p>
<img src="18263t.jpg"><br><b>18263</b> - The 5:1 geared N-20 6volt motor fits perfectly in the nose of the Kitten.  A few dabs of IC-2000 from Bob Smith Industries hold it in place.  The cross member was added after installing the motor to support the exhaust pipe detail.

<H2>J-3 Kitten In Flight</H2>
<p>
<table width=500>
<tr><td>
<img src="18360.jpg"><br><b>18360</b> - off on another patrol of the local park.
<p>
<img src="18374w.jpg"><br><b>18374</b> - The J-3 Kitten floats out of my hand for the start of another fun flight.
<p>
<img src="18310w.jpg"><br><b>18310</b> - The Kitten is great for patroling the local park.
<p>
<img src="18338w.jpg"><br><b>18338</b> - Smooth realistic flybys on a calm afternoon makes the Kitten a joy to fly.
<p>
<img src="18416s.jpg"><br><b>18416</b> - The trees in the local park are no problem for the Kitten.  It will easily manuever within tight areas.
<p>
<img src="18435.jpg"><br><b>18435</b> - The Kitten will easily turn in tight spaces, and usually dodges most of the trees and bushes.
<p>
<img src="18479s.jpg"><br><b>18479</b> - off on another patrol of the local park.
<p>
<img src="18488.jpg"><br><b>18488</b> - The Kitten was fine after this bit of "bush flying".
<p>
<img src="18317.jpg"><br><b>18317</b> - A calm clear sky, and a fun flying predictable model.  What more can you ask?
<p>
<img src="18274.jpg"><br><b>18274</b> - The trees are no problem for the Kitten.  It will easily manuever within tight areas.  A baseball infield is more than enough room.
