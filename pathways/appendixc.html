<h2>Lesson Plan Preparation</h2>
</CENTER><p>
Teachers may use a document, often called a lesson plan, to organize the elements of a subject that is to be taught on a given day, or days.  It identifies objectives, preparation required, and evaluation. A lesson plan covers an element of a course of study.
<p>
This appendix is intended to acquaint the reader with reference material that will assist one in the design and preparation of a draft lesson plan for a teacher's consideration.
<p>
Don't limit your review of the following lesson plan listings to aerodynamics or aircraft.  You may find what you want in related fields such as science, mathematics, or computer technology.

<p>
<B>Lesson Plan Design</B>
<br>The following Web site illustrates some of the factors that determine how a lesson plan should be designed:
<A HREF="http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/teachereduc/indexTE.html" target="new">www.teachers.ash.org.au/teachereduc/indexTE.html</A>and click resources and click lesson ideas
<p>
