<p>
<B>2.1 Indoor vs Outdoor</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A>
<p>
Indoor models are flown in a controlled environment.  Air currents
are usually limited to drafts from heating or air conditioning vents
or the occasional opening of a door, except for the more prestigious
contests where even these are eliminated.
<p>
Indoor flying is like flying free inside of a box.  Models will
occasionally strike the ceiling or a wall. Event rules may permit
"steering" during competition, using devices like a helium filled
balloon on a string to push the model into a safer flight path.
<p>
Length of time aloft (duration) is extended by building models
light. In accordance with the laws of physics, lightweight models
suffer the least damage when they do strike an obstacle.  A thirteen
inch wingspan scale model built using conventional Japanese tissue
covering and weighing about 0.8 ounce may achieve two minutes
duration in the hands of a beginner, while 25.5 inch microfilm
covered competition models weighing less than 0.1 ounce have achieved
over one hour duration.  Microfilm (nitrocellulose film) covering
thickness is about .0000056 inches thick.  These gossamer creations
are an awe-inspiring study in slow motion.
<p>
Rapid advancements in electronic miniaturization and battery
efficiency have placed indoor radio controlled models, powered by
electric motors, within the capability of an experienced modeler.  In
the early days of radio controlled (R/C) models an airborne system's
weight was measured in pounds.  Currently, a complete radio system
for a small R/C aircraft can be purchased weighing .85 ounces less
batteries.  That's less than the weight of three 25 cent pieces.  See

weight aircraft and related equipment.
<p>
Indoor modelers also fly hand-launched gliders and rubber powered
models of every description. They are flown free flight or
controlled; for fun (sport) or competition.  They can fly year
around, and they have an advantage when it comes to access to a
flying site - any gym will do.
<p>
Outdoor modelers experience different challenges.  High winds may
ground all but the largest and heaviest models.  At the other
extreme, warm days produce updrafts (thermals) that can lift a model
out of sight and carry it for miles.  Free flight models are often
equipped with "dethermalizers"; timed devices that change the
position of flying surfaces to make the model slowly descend.  This
will happen unless the craft becomes "hung" (caught up) in a strong
updraft.  At this point, it is said to be in the hands of Hung, the
nemesis of free flight modelers.  It has been proven that the various
incantations or attempts at paying tribute have little or no effect
in this situation.  Outdoor models are launched into the wind to
achieve the advantage of the greater lift afforded by the airflow
over the wings at the time of launch.
<p>
Outdoor models may be flown free, controlled by lines (U-Control), or
radio controlled (R/C).  They may be powered by twisted rubber, CO2
motor, gas engines, a ducted fan gas engine, pulse jet engine,
turbojet engine, electric motor, or no engine at all (gliders).  They
may be flown for sport or in competition.  They may be designed for
endurance, aerobatics, speed, or scale.  Scale models must adhere to
the shape and color of a full sized prototype aircraft.
<p>
<A NAME="2.2"></A>
<B>2.2 Free Flight vs Controlled Flight</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A>
<p>

Free flight models are designed and trimmed (adjusted) to fly in
circles in order to restrict the distance they travel from the point
of the launch, whether from the confines of a field or the walls of
an indoor site.
<p>
Their power source is timed to achieve a desired height, then shut
down to glide to the ground.  In the case of an indoor free flight
model the power is reduced gradually, ideally becoming exhausted at
the moment of landing.  This occurs when a rubber model winds down or
an electric motor's battery stops producing power.
<p>
Outdoor free flight gliders may be hand launched, hand-pulled aloft
by a towline, catapulted aloft using a line composed of a cord tied
to a length of surgical rubber tubing (Hi-start), or by a powered
winch that reels in the towline to pull the glider aloft like a kite.
The glider flies off the line at the desired height and begins a
circular flight path.
<p>
Free Flight modeling is represented by many special interest groups.

Ring at:  <A HREF="http://www.webring.com" target="new">www.webring.com</A> and type Free Flight Web Ring and

<p>
U-Controlled models are usually guided by lines extending from a hand
held handle to a bellcrank (A lever having its fulcrum at the apex of
the angle formed by its two arms) within the model.  A link from the
bellcrank extends to the moveable part of the horizontal tail
affording an up or down movement that results in control of the
altitude of the model's circular flight path.
<p>
Single line systems are sometimes used on speed models or additional
lines may be used to control motor speed or other functions.  In
addition, electrical signals may be sent along the lines to provide
added control functions such as wing flaps or aircraft carrier hook
position for simulated carrier landings, etc.
<p>
Radio control of models enables the flier to guide his aircraft
within restricted spaces.  Doing so however, requires acquiring
considerable piloting skills and experience.  Ideally, the pilot must
visualize himself/herself seated in the pilot's seat.  When doing so
and the model is flying away from you, signaling left turn makes the
plane fly left.  If the model is flying toward you, signaling left
turn, the plane flies right as viewed from the ground.  Unless the
plane is flying upside down toward you, in which case, left would be
left.  This requires spatial visualization. Some are born with it,
and others never acquire it.  In addition, good depth perception is
required to judge the point that engine power should be reduced to
glide to a desired point on the landing strip.
<p>
It is possible, with a competent instructor, to start out with a
docile trainer plane and learn to fly R/C.  Perhaps the most
"user-friendly" approach would be an "almost-ready-to-fly" (ARF)
electric-powered R/C "Slow Flyer."  However, a beginning modeler who
starts with a simple free flight model, learning how to balance, trim
and adjust the craft for flight, will be far more likely to reduce
the learning curve for radio control.  This means less expense when
the inevitable crashes occur.
<p>
The ultimate RC challenge is to fly a small radio controlled plane in
a gymnasium.  With the availability of relatively low cost highly
miniaturized equipment, this is being accomplished more than ever
before.
<p>
<A NAME="2.3"></A>
<B>2.3 Endurance vs Scale</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A>
<p>

Endurance models are designed for maximum time aloft.  Without any
design constraints the model would have unlimited power to climb to a
desired altitude.  It would be light and have a lot of wing area to
permit an extended glide.  But, you guessed it; modelers who fly in
competition do have design constraints.  For a given event upper or
lower limits may be specified on:
-wingspan or wing area
-engine size or rubber weight for a rubber powered model
-fuselage (body) cross section
-construction materials permitted
-propeller diameter or material
-any other limits that may level the playing field
<p>
Despite many years of competition occurring in a given event, a canny
competitor may find a loophole in the rules and enjoy a short-lived
advantage.  For example, in the early days the first gas models were
flown in established rubber powered model contests.  It was time for
a rules change.
<p>
Scale models are built to resemble a full sized prototype as closely
as possible.  Since models do not behave in flight exactly as
full-scale craft, experts in aerodynamics have had to develop a
correction factor in order to use models in wind tunnels to study
full sized aircraft.  This correction factor, used to compensate for
scale effect, is called the Reynolds Number.  Often, the horizontal
tail may have to be increased from exact scale for good model flight,
for example.  This is usually permitted in scale competition.  In
addition to true scale, proper colors, markings, and size limits,
scale event rules also often include endurance requirements.  The
seasoned competitor, once again, will look for an advantage.  The
solution is to model a prototype that in full scale has the
characteristics best suited for model performance.  When maximum
wingspan is specified, look for a full-scale plane with a wide wing
(chord) to get the most wing area, giving the model the best lift
performance.  Eventually certain full-scale selections may be banned,
again to level the playing field.  In some contests all competitors
are required to model the same prototype.
<p>
<A NAME="2.4"></A>
<B>2.4 Competition vs Sport</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A>
<p>
Competition occurs in any of the categories covered so far, but it
turns out that more modelers fly for personal enjoyment (sport) than
those who compete.  When flying a rubber powered model in the quiet
air of dawn or dusk, the modeler will try to improve upon past
performance.  It could be said that one is actually competing with
oneself.
<p>
A recent development in model aviation is the fun fly.  Modelers
attend these events to compare notes on design, and fly without the
pressures of competition.  These events have had a pronounced effect
on the rapid acceptance of electric powered flight.  But even in
these low-key meetings, competitive fun events are flown.  A mass
launch of many attendees to see who lands last, or who can fly under
the lowest horizontal bar (limbo), for example.
<p>
<A NAME="2.5"></A>
<B>2.5 Other Types</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A>
<p>
Two examples of other challenging types of models are helicopters and
ornithopters.
<p>
Model helicopters are gaining in popularity, powered by either gas
engines or electric motors.  It requires skill to fly these craft
because like most RC models you must think ahead or the model will
get ahead of your ability to control it.  You can't just stop and
think, soon I'll make a certain move, because with your hands on the
controls every slight movement of hands creates an immediate response
from the model.
<p>
Model ornithopters are propelled by the flapping of wings.  Early
experimenters studied the flight of birds and achieved some limited
success with the wing flapping approach.  A small but dedicated group
of present day modelers enjoy the challenge of making ornithopters
fly.
