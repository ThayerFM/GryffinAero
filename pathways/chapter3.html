Now we will examine the organizationalstructure that has evolved to deal with this very diversifiedhobby/sport.<p>At the international level the Federation Aeronautique Internationale(FAI) is the world air sports federation.  In its role ofestablishing control and certification of world aeronautical recordsit establishes regulations for air sporting events which areorganized by member countries. <A HREF="http://www.fai.org/aeromodelling/" target="new">www.fai.org/aeromodelling/</A>. The FAI lists National Aeromodelling Federations for many countries at:<A HREF="http://start.fai.org/model-federations.asp?lang=en." target="new">start.fai.org/model-federations</a><p>In the case of the sport of model aviation the FAI issues a SportingCode.  In section 4c Aeromodels, rules are specified for competitionin Free Flight, Control Line, Radio Control, Scale, and Radio ControlElectric Powered models.  Sub categories are specified for each ofthe above.  For example, eleven subcategories are listed under theheading Free Flight.  Copies of the FAI Sporting Code may bedownloaded from the Internet site above or purchased from the Academyof Model Aeronautics.<p>Sport aviation is represented by the National Aeronautic Association(NAA) at the national level in the United States.  The NAA recognizeseight organizations as the governing bodies of their respective airsports <A HREF="http://www.naa-usa.org/website/" target="new">www.naa-usa.org/website/</A>.  One of these is the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA), the official governing body for model aviation.<p>To view AMA's competition regulations see<A HREF="http://www.modelaircraft.org/" target="new">www.modelaircraft.org/</A> and click Publications and click Competition Regulations and click Table of Contents and/or desired regulation.<p>Special Interest Groups (SIGs) have been formed to represent theneeds and desires of their members.  Most are recognized by AMA. Those that are not are noted with an asterisk. They assist and advise AMA. To navigate the AMA website to the SIGsrecognized by AMA, proceed as follows:<br><A HREF="http://www.modelaircraft.org/" target="new">www.modelaircraft.org/</A>and click About AMA and click Special Interest Groups.<p>When modelers gather to engage in competition (a meet) they competein specialized events in which the configuration of the model and theflying procedures are specified.  These rules and regulations areprepared by the entity that sanctions the event within the meet.To summarize, a given meet can contain events that are flown bydiffering rules established by the FAI, AMA, AMA recognized SIGs, andNon-AMA recognized SIGs.<p>The actual membership of any of these organizations is made up ofclubs.  These local clubs serve to promote their element of thehobby, to serve the needs of their members and most importantly toinform, and recruit from, the public.<p>Many rulebooks place event descriptions in categories according tothe power source to be used in the model aircraft.  I will use thepower source of the models to categorize the SIGs that play such animportant role as part of the network that governs model aviation.<p><A NAME="3.1"></A><B>3.1 Rubber Power</B> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br>Model aircraft powered by rubber "motors" have served as excellenttraining devices for beginners for many years.  They are inexpensiveto build and repair, which is an important factor as the novicedevelops trimming, adjusting and flying skills.  These activitiesoften result in "unplanned impacts".<p>Rubber models are clean and quiet in operation.  This helps modelersget and keep flying sites.  The Marin Aero Club Web site provides anintroductory overview of model aircraft construction at:<A HREF="http://www.gryffinaero.com/models/" target="new">www.gryffinaero.com/models</A> click Marin aero club info and click wonderful guideline.<p>A wide variety of model events and applications have been establishedby enthusiastic special interest groups (SIGs).  The following SIGsplay a significant role in defining and running rubber model events.<p><A NAME="3.1.1"></A><B>3.1.1  Flying Aces Club (FAC)*</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br>Although the FAC Headquarters has a small official Web site at<A HREF="http://flyingacesclub.net/" target="new">flyingacesclub.net/</A> some chapters, called squadrons, of theorganization do maintain more extensive sites as follows:<A HREF="http://www.windysock.net" target="new">www.windysock.net</A> features a monthly newsletter on theInternet.  A file of past articles provides a treasure trove ofinformation for the modeler.

Fortunately, they are attracting some of the youngerpopulation at a rate, which will probably keep the art and technologyalive for some time.  This group takes its name from a popularmodeling/aviation magazine of the 1930s called "Flying Aces".  Thismagazine was a collection of modeling articles, aviation historyarticles, and articles of sheer fiction and fantasy.<p>The Flying Aces members number over 1500 and are organized insquadrons.  The club headquarters publishes a rulebook and also anewsletter six times a year.  The newsletter contains contestinformation, technical material and plans for building models.<p>To apply for membership write to:FAC-GHQ<br>3301 Cindy Lane<br>Erie, PA 16506<br>The cost is $15.00 per year in the U. S. and Canada<br>overseas the cost is $20.00 per year.<p>Current FAC membership exceeds 1,500, and no less than 194 made theirway to Geneseo, NY to participate in the annual national contest forthe year 2000.  Many more came as spectators.<p>The aircraft flown consist primarily of scale stick and tissue,rubber-powered models.  FAC competition is designed to encouragemodelers to build good-looking aircraft that fly well.  The score onereceives in a FAC event is based upon fidelity to scale, workmanship,and flight duration.  The flight duration score is handicapped by thetype and complexity of the model.  For example, a highwing monoplanereceives no handicap points while a biplane receives 15 handicappoints.

NFFS sponsors regional and national free flightcompetitions, publishes a monthly magazine, and conducts an annualsymposium where the best ideas and scientific developments of thesport are presented and published.<p>NFFS runs the AMA free flight events in the annual indoor and outdoorNational Competition (NATS) for the AMA.<p>The NFFS also has a special rulebook that governs certain NostalgiaEvents. These competitions are to be flown with specific modelsdesigned in past years.  In addition NFFS has a Special Eventsrulebook that refers to events governed by other SIGs.<p><A NAME="3.1.3"></A><B>3.1.3  Society of Antique Modelers (SAM)</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br><A HREF="http://www.antiquemodeler.org/index2.html" target="new">www.antiquemodeler.org/index2.html</A><br>The spirit of the organization is best described in the SAM "Preamble":"The competition flying of free flight and R/C model aircraft ofvintage design is intended to be casual, enjoyable and interestingfor both competitor and spectator alike.  It is neither desired toadvance the state-of-the-art of aeromodeling, per se, other than toincrease participation in the sport generally, nor to reprove againthat which is already recorded in aeromodeling history books.The intent of these rules is to categorize the basic types of vintagemodels and establish an equitable and simple framework of regulationsfor competition purposes.<p>Therefore, model designs that revolutionize flight competition andnecessitated the formation of two basic classifications, Antique andOld Timer are expected to compete in the Old Timer Events."<p>In the Antique category models must be powered with the originalignition-type gas engines from the period.  As a result, SAM membersare very interested in the Model Engine Collectors Association<A HREF="http://www.modelengine.org/index.htm" target="new">www.modelengine.org/index.htm</A>.  However, since theavailability of old engines has dried up, modern replicas of theseengines are accepted in SAM competition.<p>A look at the SAM Rule Book-<A HREF="http://www.antiquemodeler.org/SAM_rules1998-99.htm" target="new">www.antiquemodeler.org/SAM_rules1998-99.htm</A> reveals thatSAM competition also includes glow plug ignition, rubber power,hand-launched gliders, towline gliders and compressed air motors.The Special Events Section includes the use of  electric motorpower, and there is even an event that permits "R/C assist"!!  But itmust be emphasized that old designs are the rule, and the best oldtime designs show up in large numbers at contests.  SAM has over5,000 members with chapters around the world.<p><A NAME="3.1.4"></A><B>3.1.4  Ornithopter Society (OS)*</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br><A HREF="http://www.ornithopter.org/flapflight" target="new">www.ornithopter.org/flapflight</A><br>The Ornithopter Society, founded in 1983, is an international groupof hobbyists and researchers interested in flapping-wing flight.Many of its members build successful models that fly in the same wayas birds.<p>Full-scale ornithopters piloted by humans have a reputation forfutility, but miniature ornithopters are receiving close scrutiny formilitary applications.<p>See <A HREF="http://www.ornithopter.org/flapflight/home.html" target="new">www.ornithopter.org/flapflight/home.html</A> and click how birds fly for an explanation of how birds fly.

Putz, regional science consultant forMacomb County Intermediate School District in Michigan, invited JohnC. Cairns, State Science Supervisor for Delaware Department ofInstruction, to share the SO program with Macomb County educators in1982.  A program was developed patterned after similar events inDelaware, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.  Two events were designedand conducted with considerable success in 1984.<p>Science Olympiad events are tournaments consisting of rigorousacademic interscholastic competitions featuring individual and teamevents.  Currently there are 33 different events distributed amongthree broad goal areas of science education.<p>For our purposes, we will focus on the area of "Science Applicationand Technology" and more specifically on the event called, "TheWright Stuff."  The event description states, "Students will designand build a propeller propelled aerodynamic device for the greatesttime aloft."  This translates to an indoor rubber-powered, stick andtissue model with a stick fuselage and built-up flying surfaces.Students are mentored by volunteer experienced modelers and teachersduring the construction and flying sessions.<p>There are now over 13,500 k-12 schools participating in the SO in all50 states and Ontario, Canada.  Of these, it is estimated that 30,000students are involved with the "Wright Stuff" event each year.  Thisexposure to the basics of model aviation and aerodynamics can have aprofound impact on the field of aviation if adequate follow-up istaken to assure that some of these students continue to learn moreabout design and technology through the hobby/sport of model aviation.Details of the SO model approach are covered in Chapter 6 at 6.2.<p><A NAME="3.2"></A><B>3.2  Gas Power/ Free Flight</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br>For discussion purposes the term Gas Power is applied to any two orfour stroke engine fueled by its own appropriate blend of fuel.Gas engines are used in most model aircraft applications.  They werefirst used to power free flying models.  As it became possible tocontrol models by wire or radio, free flight gas model eventparticipation has been reduced.  However, the following SIGs containdedicated modelers who enjoy diverse events and applications thathave stood the test of time.<p>Modern model gas engines are easier to start and operate than in thepast due to the use of electric starters and better engine design,plugs and fuel.  However, they must be handled with respect when itcomes to the safety of the modeler and spectators.<p><A NAME="3.2.1"></A><B>3.2.1 National Association of Scale Aeromodelers (NASA)</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br><A HREF="http://www.scaleaero.com/amascale.htm" target="new">www.scaleaero.com/amascale.htm</A> and click nasa<br>NASA was formed in 1977 at the AMA National Contest held inCalifornia.  It was created to encourage, promote, and advance allphases of scale aeromodeling including Free Flight, Control Line, andRadio Control.<p>NASA is the host of the annual AMA Scale National Championship.  Thisevent is held at the AMA National Flying Site in Muncie, Indiana.All AMA scale classes for Control Line and Radio Control are held atthis event.<p>Scale modelers require detailed information on the full-scaleaircraft that they choose to replicate.  NASA has a Scale Data SourceList that all new members receive upon joining.  NASA publishes anewsletter called Replica that is distributed to NASA membersworldwide.<p>NASA's Web site boasts 400,000 documentation resources.

Speed flyers also needed control totame models powered by large gas engines or pulse jet engines.  Asradio control systems matured, control line flying activity droppedconsiderably.  However, new applications such as simulated combat andprecision aerobatics have revived the sport somewhat.

This is followed by a timedlow speed segment.  The next segment of the flight is the landing.The landing is performed upon a simulated aircraft carrier flightdeck.  Maximum landing points are awarded for landing in a normalattitude and stopped by the arresting hook.<p>High speeds attained average 70 to 120 mph.  Low speeds may be 4 to 8mph.

PAMPA hasabout 2,500 members in 35 countries.  A newsletter called Stunt Newsis published bi-monthly.<p>The control line precision aerobatics pattern is a series of flightmaneuvers that are scored according to geometric perfection.  Whenthe pattern calls for a repeated maneuver, the repetitions must allbe in the same place.  Each of the fourteen maneuvers is awarded ascore, which is added to points awarded for the appearance of themodel.<p>The PAMPA Web site is an excellent example of what a SIG web siteshould contain.

This is why one shouldapproach R/C  flight after accumulating experience with free flightmodels, or at least begin with the aid of a competent R/C instructor.The 13 SIGs listed below are evidence of the diversity and popularityof this phase of model aviation.  Despite the noise reductionafforded by better muffler systems, flying sites are dwindling assuburbs replace the wide-open fields of the past.  It should be notedthat gas-powered models are limited to outdoor flying.<p>Related Web sites:<br><A HREF="http://www.fmadirect.com" target="new">www.fmadirect.com</a>  radio control components, links and frequently asked questions.<br><A HREF="http://www.gettingstartedinrc.com/" target="new">www.gettingstartedinrc.com</A> and click planes<br><A HREF="http://www.charlesriverrc.org/" target="new">www.charlesriverrc.org/</A>  getting started and links<br><A HREF="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/index.htm" target="new">www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/index.htm</A>  extensive links<br><A HREF="http://www.modelaircraft.org" target="new">www.modelaircraft.org</a> and click Publications and click Model Aviation and click Click here for online features from Model Aviation.

The initialrules were presented to the AMA R/C Committee in 1956.  AMA ruleswere finalized in 1959.  In the mid-sixties there was a desire torace scale model aircraft simultaneously over a triangular coursesimilar to full size Goodyear Racers flown in the late forties.  R/Cpylon racing has developed into three classes or events that areseparated by aircraft requirements, engine specifications, fuelrestrictions and course length.<p>The AMA recognizes five classes of R/C pylon racing for U. S.competition.  All are intended for multi-channel R/C aircraft poweredby conventional two-stroke glow engines.  The task consists of an ROG(rise off ground) takeoff (or in the case of  &Pi; A, a hand launch)followed by left turns around a closed course marked by pylons.For more information see:  <A HREF="http://home.san.rr.com/thedrewpages/" target="new">home.san.rr.com/thedrewpages/</A> and click racers reference<p><A NAME="3.4.10"></A><B>3.4.10  Scale Warbird Racing Association (SWRA)</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br><A HREF="http://www.warbirdracing.com" target="new">www.warbirdracing.com</A><br>The SWRA was formed for those individuals who are interested in thethrill, excitement, and nostalgia of racing radio controlled modelaircraft of piston-driven warbirds and replicas of the Unlimited RenoRacers.<p>SWRA serves as an AMA SIG to develop and update unified rules,coordinate racing dates for events, and maintain national seasonpoint totals for member competitors in the fixed bracket-racingformat.<p><A NAME="3.4.11"></A><B>3.4.11  Unlimited Scale Racing Association (USRA)</b> - <A HREF="#top">return to top</A><br><A HREF="http://www.usrainfo.org/main.htm" target="new">www.usrainfo.org/main.htm</A><br>USRA serves as an AMA SIG as the official sanctioning and rules bodyfor the sport of Giant Scale Air Racing.  Founded in 1994, thepurpose of the USRA is to provide a set of racing rules andprocedures and to separate those racing rules and procedures from thepromotional aspects of the racing event organizers.<p>The USRA serves to advance the sport of giant scale air racing in theareas of competition, safety and technology development for thebenefit of those persons interested in the design, construction andflight of giant scale racing aircraft.<p>Giant scale air racing is patterned after the Reno National Air Racesas a way to bring the excitement, sound, color and history of airracing up close to the public and the world of radio controlenthusiasts.  Speeds well in excess of 200 mph make giant scale airracing one of the fastest motor sports in the world.<p>USRA racing encompasses 6 classes.  The heavyweights are theUnlimited and Experimental classes where the maximum aircraft weight(wet) is 55 pounds.
