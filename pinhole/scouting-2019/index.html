In the spring of 2018 I had an urge to revisit analog photo processes, built a 4x5 pinhole camera, and tried a few initial exposures with paper negatives. They ended up with very high contrast, and I wasn't too happy with the results at the time, so let the camera collect dust over the winter while I moved on to other pursuits.
<p>
A year later I decided to give it another go, and ordered up a box of film for round two. These are a few images made with that camera using film. Most were captured during a 5-day canoe expedition through the Adirondacks in July 2019 with five members of Gryffin's Scout troop. Two images were made after returning to Henderson Scout Reservation, and the last was exposed in similar lighting conditions at home, as a sacrificial developing test.
<p>
For the technically inclined, I used Ilford FP4 Plus black and white film, tray-processed in Ilfosol 3 developer. Note that these images do not represent finished prints. They are just quick "scans" of the negatives, made using my Canon DSLR.
<p>
The camera body is constructed from pine, cherry, and mahogany plywood, with a few brass accents. I also steam-bent strips of hickory to form the springs which secure the film holder. The camera features a 75mm focal length, and an effective aperture of F205. The pinhole diameter is 0.014 inches, and was formed in 0.002-inch brass shim stock using a pin.
<p>
The small pinhole requires exposure times (listed under each image) that are much too long for handholding the camera. The third image was exposed for a relatively brief two seconds, made possible by the direct sunlight about two hours after sunrise. For comparison, a conventional camera using this same film could have captured that same view in 1/125 of a second. I used the tabletop tripod shown for stability throughout our trip, and a full-size tripod for the last three images.
<p>
The 75mm focal length gives an angle of view similar to that realized with a full frame 35mm SLR and 24 mm lens. The diagonal angle of view is just over 90 degrees, which translates to about 80 degrees across the 5-inch length of the image area, and 68 degrees along the shorter 4-inch dimension.
<p>
I left the camera back open to allow easy access to the pinhole and shutter mechanism. This also allowed packing my light meter and exposure calculator within the camera body during the canoe trip. The small brass screws on the camera top and right side assist framing, though nothing is guaranteed with a pinhole camera.
