I was lucky enough to get  back to Rockport for a few days in 2019, and brought my 4x5 pinhole camera again, this time with a few sheets of film. The morning I photographed started quite foggy, with the sun burning off the fog while I was out and about.
<p>
Even the relatively slow ISO 100 film is much more sensitive than photo paper, and these exposures were quite a bit shorter than those of my previous visit. Typical times were around 20-40 seconds in the fog, and as short as 3-5 seconds in the sun.
