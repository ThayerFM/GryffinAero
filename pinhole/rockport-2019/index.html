I was lucky enough to get  back to Rockport for a few days in 2019, and brought my 4x5 pinhole camera with a few sheets of film. Most of these images were captured on a foggy morning, though it did burn off later.
<p>
Even my relatively slow ISO 100 film is much more sensitive than photo paper, and these exposures were quite a bit shorter than those of my previous visit. Typical times were around 20-40 seconds in the fog, and as short as 3--5 seconds in the sun.
