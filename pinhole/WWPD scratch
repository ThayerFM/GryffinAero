My initial results with direct positive paper had been inconsistent, so I also made a 4x5 back up exposure of the same scene, using a sheet of expired TMax 100. This exposure calculated at 3 minutes at f205, and doubling that to 6 minutes was still not enough for the sensitivity losses due to reciprocity and age.
