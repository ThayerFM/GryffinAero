Here are some of Dick Baxter's opinions on "starting point" kits and designs for the Science Olympiad 1999/2000 airplane competitions.
<p>
While specifically addressing the constraints of the Science Olympiad rules, these thoughts are also a good start for the Technology Student Association competition.

<p><H3>3 books you might want:</H3> The first two should have a lot of practical detail about rubber band powered stuff. Gitlow will be about very light weight indoor stuff and Ross about heavier outdoor stuff. SO airplanes are really intermediate between light weight indoor stuff and 
normal outdoor models.

<br>My copy cost $14.25 about 10 years ago. I think you can find this on Amazon.com or Hannans.

The Simons book is a college level aero engineering text about model airplanes. Simons does not pull punches but the book is readable around the equations if you really like this stuff. Simons isn't about construction but will tell you how things really work.

<B>Some of the model designs or kits that make good starting places for the S.O. competition.
</B><p>

<ul>
<li>
<B>Midwest Product's Right Flier</B>. Slightly too small and rather too heavy.  Includes landing gear. Available as bulk kit for 8 models. Right fliers and variations have won several SO competitions in the past. The  Right Flier and some variations are described at <A HREF="http://www.midwestproducts.com/eduhome.htm">http://www.midwestproducts.com/eduhome.htm</A>
<p>
<li>
<B>Midwest Product's Sorcerer</B>.  Midwest Industries entry in the Science Olympiad kit selection. Designed by Tom Sanders who pretty much invented the SO airplane competition.  It looks pretty ease to build and should fly very well.
<p>
Sorcerer, kit # 525, $29.95 plus S&H (two basic models can be built)...
<br>Features:
<ol>
<li>Laser Cut 1/16" cambered ribs, spoked wheels (3/4" diam) and gussets.
<li>4 propellers, 2ea 8" Peck Grays, 2ea 6" Tern Aero Style
<li>Esaki Tissue
<li>Design: High wing, tip dihedral, two pc fuselage, lifting stab. fuselage- motorstick (laminated for torsional strength) and tailboom. Uses "boomlock" to hold tailboom and give trim adjustments.
<li> Easy to read plan with iso views of critial assemblies, extensive "teaching" instructions.
<li>Midwest Microcut balsa wood

<p>
<li>
<B>Indoor Model Supply Slo Poke</B>. Also a little small and maybe a little light structure. Lew Gitlow at Indoor Model Supply has already designed a plane to match the SO 2000 specifications.

<B>Double Whammy plan</B> from the October or November 1999 Model Aviation magazine. A little small, reasonable structure, but needs a cambered wing.

<H3>Probable mods most kits will need.</H3>
<p>
Basically, scale (up or down) your kit to 50 cm span, Use a cambered (curved) airfoil. Scrape a 9" Peck Polymers prop down to 2 to 2.5 grams (before trimming) and then trim to allowed size. Do not allow the model to be overweight by more than 1/2 gram. Practice a lot These airplanes will probably want a loop of .075 to .080 wide Tan II rubber to get best duration. 1/16 is too thin and 3/32 is too wide.
<p>
You will find that most (maybe all) kits you can find are too big or too small. Bite the bullet and scale the sizes to the max allowed wing span, and maybe wing chord. Rescale the tail as well and make the motor stick as long as the motor that works for you. Use a tail boom if the motor stick is too short. Obviously you need to do some trial and error modifications to get the best airplane. 
<p>
I tell beginners they need to build at least 3 airplanes. Number 1 is to get errors out of your system and to use for flying practice. Number 2 is a prototype competition airplane you use to get wood sizes and component weights right and correct errors in incidence, tail size, dihedral and so on. If number 2 does not fly to suit you modify it until it does. Don't hesitate to replace parts you think are not right. This is an experiment in performance optimization.  Also use number 2 for flying practice. Number 3 is your competition airplane. It should weigh between 8 and 8.5 grams and should not surprise you in flight if you modified number 2 enough before you were done with it. Fly number 3 enough so you can pretty consistently predict what it will do. If you have time and energy, build number 4 as a spare competition airplane. Make parts interchangeable with number 3, but assemble it and fly it until it  is reliable. 
<p>
My guess is that winning times for the 1999/2000 season will be on the high side of 2 1/2 minutes in High School and maybe 3 minutes in Middle school. The middle school students don't have to drag a landing gear around. To be competitive, you should work for at least 2 minutes under a 20+ foot ceiling, even at the local level.
<p>
good flying
