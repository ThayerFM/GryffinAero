I am the coach for the Science Olympiad team at Our Mother of Sorrows School in Tucson, AZ.  We participate in Science related competition against other schools in Arizona.  Our season is over this year , but I would like to know if there is someone in our area that would be willing to help our team with a rubber band propelled plane for next year.  Our plane came in at 4th place at state this year.  The rules vary from year to year, forcing new planes to be built each year.  
If you have someone willing to help out some 6th 7th and 8th grade students, please call, and I will fill you in on how our is structured.
Thank you

I am a science olympiad student that competed in the "Wright Stuff" event last year.  My partner and I were able to achieve 2 1/2 minutes by testing and experimenting by ourselves, but we were blown away by some of the teams at nationals.  Apparently 5 minutes should be attainable by our class of plane.  The rules have slightly changed for next year, but we are anxious to get a good jump start over the summer.  We are looking for anyone who could give any help, especially in the area of props/rubber.  We feel the only major difference between our plane and the national competitors was that they had a better rubber/propeller combination, and used a much better pitch for their plane etc.  This year we are pulling out all the stops and we would like to achieve at least 4 minutes.  We are also looking into rolled tube fuselages, but don't entirely know where to start.  We may have some help lined up for next fall, but any help, especially over the summer, is very welcome.  thanks a bunch!

Well, we finally thought we had a competitive plane for Science Olympics, flew 52 s at the state finals... then we found out the leaders were around 2 minutes! I think we're on the right track, using a modified IMS plane with a trimmed down 7" prop, weighed in at 10.3 g less prop.  I'm just wondering at this point: is most of the additional magic that we seek in that prop, or trim of the plane?

Thx, Pat

HELP!!  I need to get my son started in building his plane for Sci. Olym. we have NO experience what so ever but a lot of enthusiasum, have read the informational material and just need someone to get my son started in the right direction!  We bought a plane kit recommended at the coaches meeting by Mr. Fred Tellier who was extreemly helful and talked to me extensively after the meeting. I am in the process of getting the items needed to build but need a sence of direction. We do not have a gram scale, so do I need to build one for my son to use in building? We plan on attending, with my son, the Feb. 9 flying club meeting and my son wants to attempt to fly his plane at the following meeting but do not know if he can get his plane build by then.  Is there a way of calling or e-mailing Mr. Tellier to see if he can assist us?  Thanking you in advance.   Stan Nunes

My personal best time is 40 seconds and I average 30 seconds on most given days.  I would like tips and a person to talk to for troubleshooting.  Also these tips should include material types, plans, etc.  This is my first year in this event and have read the offical Science Olympiad Propellar Propulsion Coaches Handbook.

I coach the Science Olympiad team at Liberty HS. Free flight ROG is a new event this year and I have no idea where to start. We could use any advice you could give. If there is someone in our area who is into this hobby, we would love to talk with him and see some planes in action.

Hi,
Looking for an E-mail mentor or someone in the Vancouver Washington area to help me with my Penny Plane, I've got it built and it looks cool. But I'm having trouble getting it to fly properly. I'm working on this for Science Olympiad that will be held in Vancouver at Clark College on March 20 1999. Any suggestions would be greatly appriciated.

I'd like to know more about the Wright Stuff. My students had very limited success building planes.  After dozens of expensive and frustrating failures, we finally managed to get a one minute flight. Our planes were still very heavy (11+ grams).  At the nationals, there were planes going four minutes.  Would anyone share at least some construction techniques?  I'd like to know more about these awesome little planes and where to go for some help getting the kids' planes up and flying for more than a minute.  We are very isolated.  Supplies and people are all a long way from here.

Any information related directly to TSA competition, we bring a team over once every 2nd year, and the event guidelines have changed since Pittsburgh 1998.
