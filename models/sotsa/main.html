<H1>Calling all Free Flight Volunteers!</H1>

<B>Join the ranks</B> of other Free Flight enthusiasts who are assisting their local school teams in free flight competitions.  Two national non-profit education organizations, the <a href="http://www.soinc.org/">Science Olympiad</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.tsawww.org/">Technology Student Association</A>, run regional, state, and national competitions in many science and technology oriented events in efforts to identify the highest ranking team in the nation.  Both organizations now include events for flying gliders and rubber powered aircraft for highest time aloft.  
<p>
During past two years, these events have become the most popular of up to 25 other event choices!  There is even a <A HREF="soblat-2.html">free plan here</A> to get you started with a rubber powered model.  Dick Baxter has prepared a list of <A HREF="soplanes.html">suggested models and tips</A> to help out as well.
<p>
The school teams are all clamoring for <A HREF="vollist.html">Free Flight mentors LIKE YOU</A> to assist them in their efforts to design, construct and, most importantly, fly their creations into the winner's circle.
<p>
Your rewards may be many!  First, you will be nurturing new friends into a most uplifting pastime!  Secondly, education will further embrace FF for its learning and social worth.  And, finally, you will enjoy the loftier heights of respect in your community.  This will be especially important when you need clout for securing new sites.  Before filling out the <A HREF="volform.html">Volunteer's Form</A>, we invite you to visit these two national websites. You can also check the <A HREF="assist.html">Assistance Needed List</A> to see if someone near you needs help.
