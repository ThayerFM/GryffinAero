I have been helping a number of students here in Wichita for the last couple of years with the rubber aircraft event in the Sci Oly competition.  They have done fairly well, at least at the state level. That has resulted in a increased number of requests to tutor. Unfortunately (or maybe not) that has resulted in too many demands.  To alleviate the situation some what, I've written a construction article to help others.  I freely admit stealing a lot from various sources. The Kansas state coordinator has managed to get the article on its web site.

If you get a chance please have a look at <a href="http://web.physics.twsu.edu/facsme/scioly.htm">the Kansas SO site</a>.  Links to it are towards the bottom of the page.  It is a little large, so there are a number of pages.

I have retired from Radionics and my new e-mail address is shown above. Also, I have been working on a kit for Science Olympiad (called Bambino) as well as a double spring scale (0-1 gram and 0-10 grams)to weigh parts and rubber. I could use some help getting the word of these out, although it is probably too late this year. The model kit is different - 10 pages of instructions take a complete novice through each step to get an 8-gram competitive model. Laser-cut wheels and rib template.

An indoor freeflight modeller for 45 years, I have held numerous national records. Two years ago, I assisted the MA winner (Belmont). Last year she placed second with the same model. This year a late start with the Wayland Jr. High resulted in a third place finish behind that same Belmont model. Wait until next year! I also have a small business supplying special tools for indoor modelling, including rubber strippers.

Hi:
<br>Have been envolved with free flight since the early 60's. Have flown indoors at Lakehurst and at Columbia Univ. in N.Y. city.  Have been a charter member of the Scale Old Timers Society since the early 70's.  Enjoy FAC events and flying HLG's. Would like to help in the South Jersey area if possible.  Have known Tom Sanders since he started building models.
<br>Best regards and Thermals and good DT's

I have built models for more than 50 years, including freeflight, control line and radio control.  Currently most of my models are simple indoor rubber powered models along with a lot of rubber powered scale models.  
<p>I would be glad to answer questions and help out in any way I can.</TD></tr>

When my children were in school, I coached OM (odyssey of the Mind) for over 12 years. During that time I worked with elementary, middle, and high school teams. 5 times my teams took first place in regional, and state competitions. These wins allowed our teams to go to the World Finals 5 times. One of my teams took 2nd place in the world finals. While at the worlds on one occasion I won 1st place in the special coaches competition. I enjoy working with children and young adults and would welcome an opportunity to work with them again.

I am retired and have time to train newcomers for fly RC airplanes and helicopters. I've developed a method to not only train beginners how to fly, but train them how to teach others, all within one week's time. That is the crux of my National Growth Program. Teachers anywhere could learn how to teach their students to fly RC aircraft.

I have been in free flight modeling, indoor and out, off and on since 1941. More to the point, I have taught a senior high model aircraft course and have been involved both as a mentor and contest official in the Science Olympiad Propeller Propulsion event for the past four years. This includes officiating at the New York State competition on March 13, 1999, at West Point. I have given numerous indoor model flight demontrations and am ready, willing, and able to do more if called upon.

I have flown all aspects of our hobby off and on since I was 5.  I am 54 and retired on disability so I do have a fair amout of time to do something like this now.  I fly mostly indoor duration and a little bit of indoor rc.  I am in the far N.E. corner of Oklahoma ( I can almost throw rocks to the KS and MO borders)and would like to volenteer to be a mentor to anyone who needs one within an hour or twos drive.  In the 60's as a junior I held national records for cat 1 sites and placed at the old Navy Nats.  I am not a top flyer, but I do know how to build light, straight and I know how to adjust most models for the best performance that the model is capable of acheiving.  I have talked to the local TSA teacher at the school that my son's attend but for the last 2 years he has never told me when the class would be working on SO type material.

Experience in building FF gliders (40 years) and indoor endurance models (20 years) for fun and educational purposes.  Promote aeromodeling in schools by conducting teacher/student workshops, as time permits, using model aviation as a tool to inspire youth to better understand essential learning requirements in the areas of "math, science and vocational education."  The lessons we learn (the models we fly) reflects our time and dedication.
