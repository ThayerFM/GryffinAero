Believe it or not, nearly 30 hours of work is repesented by this photo.  As much as I could, I tried to make fixtures for cutting each piece as accurately, and easily as possible.  For instance, all the truss members were cut using <A HREF="miter.html">custom miter boxes</A>, to alieviate the need for sanding each piece for final fitting.  The miter boxes were made by ripping pieces of pine to an H-cross section.  One set of trusses was carefully made, and then used as patterns for cutting the slots and angles in the miter boxes.
<p>
The gussets are 1/16 Mahogany plywood, cut on a table saw with a sliding tray configured for proper angles for each piece.  One time saving hint mentioned that gussets are not precision devices.  A standard Hatz rib has 17 gussets, nearly all are drawn to slightly different shapes.  By allowing some to run a little larger, and get trimmed later when the ribs are being sanded anyway, I was able to get away with just 2 sizes of triangles for 11 locations.  These are clearly seen in the photo as the two large piles in the foreground.  The paper cups hold the other 6 "custom" gussets.  After gluing, any overhanging gussets and glue drips are removed with a quick pass on a disk sander.
<p>
The curved ply pieces to the left were rough cut on a scroll saw, then final shaped by  clamping to a pattern, and running around them with a ball bearing guided router bit.  The odd pieces on the right join the trailing edge ends of the capstrips, and were cut on a table saw using a 7 step sliding tray jig.
