<TR><TD><IMG SRC="hatzpix/10rib.jpg" </TD><TD>Here are the first 10 ribs completed.  I couldn't help but line them up to get a hint of what is to come.  The volume of a wing can not be appreciated by holding a single rib in your hand.  A finished wing will not have 10 similar ribs however, as allowance must be made for the ailerons, as well as local reinforcement of the spars where struts and wires attach.
<p>Sharp eyes will notice a couple pieces missing.  To allow easier assembly to the spars, two vertical trusses, and their diagonal braces, were left out.  these will be added when the spars are in place.
