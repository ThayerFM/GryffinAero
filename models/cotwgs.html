<p>
The Cottage Wings Guide was originally compiled for Free Flight scale modellers by 
Bill Warner. For a number of years, updates and additions were done by the late 
Carlo Godel who brought this list to the Internet. It is not connected in any way 
with the AMA, and the endorsements, where they occur, are the result of Bill Warner's 
and Carlo's own personal experience or as noted.
</p><p>
With Carlo's untimely passing, I have temporarily posted this file on my web site. 
I have made a few initial edits of entries that I know to be out of date, and am 
also making an effort to make the guide a little more web-friendly. It will remain 
available free as a download at this web site. Please send requests, additions or 
corrections to Thayer Syme through the <a href="https://store.flying-models.com/catalog/contact_us.php" target="fm">Flying Models</a> contact page.

</p><p>
Note: Prices quoted for catalogs etc., may be out of date, as also may be some 
addresses. Prices are usually for the U.S. market and will probably be higher abroad. 
Sending a large SASE, and if it is abroad, two International Reply Coupons that are 
available at the P.O. is suggested. Vendors generally prefer the sending of U.S. 
currency to Europe, because the cost of processing International Money Orders is 
high. Many take Visa.
</p><p>
I suggest a phone call to anyone you have not previously done business with as 
the best way to clarify present prices and method of payment.

It is with a sad and heavy heart that we announce the passing of Al Lidberg in June of 2017. His family has since shuttered the Model Airplane Plans business. Please watch this listing for updates, when and if the family decides to do something with his plans. 
<p>
Lidberg had a large range of fine plans from small "profile" scale ships to more advanced built-up rubber scale jobs with knock-off wings and advanced techniques well laid out in print for you. Good instructions with each, too. He is well known for a series of miniature mini old timer semi-kits for CO2 or mini-elec. including the New Ruler, Buzzard Bombshell, Goldberg Interceptor, Kerswap!,  Brooklyn Dodger, Miss America, Wedgy, and Rocketeer A. His Cessna Airmaster jumbo is dynamite: I've seen it fly- wow! The Texas Temple monoplane plan packet was also a delight! BW CG TS

<br>5 gram electric motor for peanut scale models. This tiny unit is cute, and can be had with gears and different prop/battery combinations. I have seen 4-engines profile jobs fly great with these. May be slow on delivery, though, as they're all home made units. Motor w/o gears, batt. Only about $6. - smaller than the Kodak disc-camera unit. KENWAY has a new tiny electric geared unit for peanut-sized models powered by a capacitor rather than batteries.  There are good reports on it, but also I have heard of a capacitor exploding on being overcharged, and the motor being prone to give more trouble than the "larger" Kenways. Note: some of the OFFC guys are using small 10 OHM potentiometers with the standard direct drive Kenways, which allows the power to be adjusted for indoor flight (put the pot in the positive lead to the motor). They use two pots for twins and give one motor slightly more R's to adj. flight circle! Kenway sells the pots for $2.95 ea. but they can often be found in surplus for 30 cents. BWCG

I must admit that I'd go for the Harding 1992 FAC NATS tape (see Harding) if I really wanted a polished version to show at a Boy Scout meeting. The 1992 Swamp tape is twice as long, though, and covers the Cole Palen banquet talk.
