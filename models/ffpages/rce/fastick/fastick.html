This model was little more than an overgrown rubber powered R.O.G. stick model with a fuselage platform for equipment installation.  By mounting everything out in the open, it was readily available for the inevitable fidgeting and experimenting.<p>The FA Stick was quick, easy and cheap to build, and it flew exceptionally well to boot. All of these traits make a smaller version a natural for experimenting with and testing the new micro radio gear and propulsion systems.<p>Were I to make another today, I would try the power and control systems from one of the new micro indoor RC models readily available at your local hobby shop. Their single-cell LiPo operation would inevitably save quite a bit of weight. A quick estimate suggests the weight could nearly be cut in half, slowing the FA Stick significantly for indoor flying.</table><p><img src="15527.jpg"><p><table width=400 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 border=0><tr><td align=right><b>span:</b></td><td> - </td><td>24"</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>area:</b></td><td> - </td><td>95 sq in.</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>weight:</b></td><td> - </td><td>2.1 oz</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>wing loading:</b></td><td> - </td><td>3.2 oz/sq ft</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>motor:</b></td><td> - </td><td>N20-6V 5:1*</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>prop:</b></td><td> - </td><td>WES16x12 Carbon*</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>battery:</b></td><td> - </td><td>5x50 ma</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>servos:</b></td><td> - </td><td>Wes-Technik *</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>rx:</b></td><td> - </td><td>Skyhooks and Rigging Hybrid with ESC</td></tr><tr><td align=right></td><td> </td><td>* <font size=-1>These components were purchased from <A HREF="http://www.toddsmodels.com/" target=new> Todd's Models</A> though I believe they have since closed shop.</font></td></tr></table><tr><td><table><tr><th></th><td><p></td></table><p><p><table width=450 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 border=0><tr><td>This model was featured as a construction article in the May 2000 issue of RCMicroFlight, now out of print.
