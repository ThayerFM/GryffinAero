</td></tr><tr><td>This model of the 1916 Bellanca CD Tractor Biplane was inspired by a Peanut Scale plan by Don Butman in the first model airplane magazine I ever saw, a copy of Model Builder from October 1972. I have had great success with a rubber powered <a href="../../models/peanuts1.html">FF version</a> at that size and decided it would be a fun project for my first slow fly RC model.</td></tr><tr><td>Initial test flights occurred on October 27, 1999 outdoors in what seemed like no wind. The first flight was with a 8x50mAh battery. Next I tried a 6x120mAh pack.  Performance seemed similar with both batteries.  As near as I could tell, the flight was very slow and graceful. Micro turbulence was abundant and made a more accurate flight assessment difficult. With more experience the model has proved itself quite capable outdoors, though is obviously wind limited.<p>Further testing indoors was a great success. Flight duration is just over 3 minutes with the 50mAh pack.  With the larger 6x120mAh pack the initial climb is slightly reduced due to a lower voltage and higher weight, though duration increased to over 9:30. I am now flying with an 8x120mAh pack and am happy with both the performance and flight times over 8 minutes. The model will turn quite sharply and has be flown within a smaller than standard basketball court.</td></tr><tr><th><img src="rear.jpg" alt="rear view" width=450 height=220></th></tr></table><table width=400 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3 border=0><tr><td align=right width=100><b>span:</b></td><td>33 inches</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>area:</b></td><td>340 square inches</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>weight:</b></td><td>6.5 ounces </td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>wing loading:</b></td><td>2.75 oz/sq ft</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>motor:</b></td><td>DC1717</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>prop:</b></td><td>Braun 26cm x 13cm</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>battery:</b></td><td>8x50mAh, 6x120mAh, 8x120mAh</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>servos:</b></td><td>Cirrus CS-10bb</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>rx:</b></td><td>Skyhooks and Rigging Hybrid with ESC</td></tr></table><table width=685 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 border=0><tr><td><img src="pilots.jpg" alt="Pilots"  WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200></td><td>Construction is traditional stick and Japanese tissue, doped with 50:50 non-tautening nitrate.  The aluminum cowling was simulated with Coverite's Micafilm, a.k.a. Fibafilm by Solarfilm and is now discontinued. As an alternative, I now recommend aluminum lithoplate. Yes, it is a little heavier, but the weight forward of the CG will help balance the model. The wheels are a pair of prototype 2 3/4 inch wheels which I made, protected by a sprung axle.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>The pilots are enlargements of the profile pilots shown on the original peanut plan.  If I remember the article correctly, they were the work of Don's son. The drawings were laminated to light 1/8 inch sheet balsa cut to shape, and colored with art markers.<p>
This model was also featured as a construction article in the January 2000 issue of RCMicroFlight.  Rolled full sized plans are available for purchase through the Flying Models plans service.
