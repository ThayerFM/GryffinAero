I made my first visit to the KRC Electric Fly-In in the fall of 1994, and came home convinced that electric models could exhibit sparkling performance. To demonstrate that belief to other nonbelievers, I built this Speed 400 pylon racer designed and kitted by Bill Griggs.

Despite a motor costing about $10, this small model really gets up goes. In the lower half of the picture you can easily see the T-tail configuration and the cooling air exit hole.  This also double as a finger rest during a launch.
