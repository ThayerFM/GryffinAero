FS40 is my favorite setup.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="Eindecker_4543.jpg" width=500 height=291 border=5 align=left hspace=10></p><p>This 40cc four-stroke engine burns gasoline and seems to be a perfect combination for this model at its current weight.</p><p>It will easily putter along at a partial throttle setting and the sound is fantastic. At full throttle it leaps off the ground in only a few yards and will climb at nearly any angle I choose.</p><p>Despite the temptation, I still try to fly it as realistically a possible.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="Eindecker_4553.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=5 align=left hspace=10><p>The Eindecker went together quickly and without bother, despite its size. Similarly, no special tools were required.</p><p>If you have successfully built and flown a couple of smaller glow sport flyers, this model is well within reach.</p><p>I also found it an easy plane to fly once completed. As such, it makes a great introduction to giant scale modeling.</p><p>Its tried and true formula for success is a solid airframe, reliable power and light wing loading.</p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="Eindecker_4532.jpg" width=500 height=375 border=5 align=right hspace=10></p><p>The Fokker Eindecker was justly feared during the early days of WWI aerial combat.</p><p>The first aircraft deployed in quantity with an interrupter gear, the Eindecker was able to shoot directly through the propeller arc.</p><p>Aiming your weapon was as simple as pointing your aircraft at your target, and its combat results quickly proved the value of this capability. </p><p>For many Allied pilots and observers, this was their last view of the nimble little monoplane.   </p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="flying 637T4562.jpg" width=400 height=456 border=5 align=right hspace=10></p><p>Despite its bellicose origins, the Fokker Eindecker makes a wonderful model subject and is perfect for warm sunny days as shown at right.</p><p>The SR Batteries Eindecker was never intended to be a contest-caliber model. It is simply a pleasing sport scale flyer, well suited for every day outings, and is sure to put a smile on your face. As such, it admirably fulfills that enjoyable mission.</p><p>You also don't have to feel tied to a scale color scheme. The cowl markings and numbers adorning my model are completely fictitious.</p><p>It rigs quickly at the field, with just the two aileron servos to plug in and four 4-40 lock nuts to secure the wings and rigging.</p><p>Functional bungee cords and large wheels will smooth out your runway for picture-perfect take offs and landings, encouraging you to work on your touch and goes between combat missions. </p>
<p>The finish is Solartex, lightly weathered with wood stain. The markings were all hand painted with Nelson Hobby / System 3 products.
