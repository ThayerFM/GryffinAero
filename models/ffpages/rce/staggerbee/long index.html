<p>
Building on the huge success of his Lazy Bee, Andy Clancy released his original Stagger Bee biplane kits in early 2001. I'm a sucker for most anything with two wings <a href="http://www.gryffinaero.com/models/ffpages/rce/quadruplane/index.html" target="4"><font color=blue><u>(or more!)</u></font></a>, and immediately fell in love with its whimsical silhouette. There was no hesitation when I was offered the chance to review a kit, and soon had it together and ready for testing.
<p>
Part of my plan was to try out a series of power systems, and I eventually settled on Astro Flight's then-new brushless 05 motor with gear reduction, and an 8-cell nicad pack that weighed over a pound. Despite its portly 40-ounce flying weight, I greatly enjoyed flying the single engine Stagger Bee, and found myself on the phone with Clancy about the time Model Airplane News published my review in September 2001. I mused that would be fun to do another one as a trimotor, as those big, funky landing gear spats seemed to be calling for a pair of nacelles above them. A few days later I had another kit in hand, and jumped right in.
<p>
Most electric modelers at that time were flying brushed motors with nickel cadmium, or nickel metal hydride batteries. Brushless motors were just starting to appear, and Lithium Polymer batteries were still a couple of years in the future. Consequently, it didn't seem too out of place to think a set of Speed 400 motors turning Gunther props was a good idea, though we did consider what might happen to the overall weight.
<p>
In addition to adding the nacelles, I also stretched the wings, based on Clancy's previous testing with larger wings. We both felt that after hanging 8 ounces of anemic motors off this beauty, and adding a larger battery to drive them all, a few extra squares made sense. In the end the wing spans grew from 29 inches over 24, to 35 over 29, and I had picked up 110 square inches. Unfortunately, a healthy dose of life's distractions kicked in about then, and despite being nearly done, I never plugged in the covering iron.
<p>
The trimotor Stagger Bee languished in various dusty corners of workshops on both sides of the country for the next 17 years, until just a couple of weeks before the 2018 NEAT Fair. I still had the entire airframe, and had collected a few 7.2V Speed 400 motors in anticipation of eventually getting it back on the bench. One issue was the Gunther props. I could only find one, so needed at least two more, plus hopefully a few spares. A quick email to a few friends saw several more props going home with me after the NEAT Fair that year, and I knew I had to have it ready when we all got together again in 2019.
<p>
While I had thought the woodwork was done, I still managed to busy myself gluing and sanding for a few evenings before covering the flying surfaces just before NEAT 2019. I ended up covering the fuselage in our flight line tent late one night while at the show.
<p>
No, it did not fly at NEAT. I did give it a try, though without properly checking the CG. I say properly, as I had checked before covering and installing the battery tray. It balanced 1 %frac38; ahead of the goal at that point, and I foolishly never checked it again. The battery was well aft, and I regained appreciation for Clancy's idea of securing all the components with rubber bands.
<p>I have since moved the battery forward and found it every bit as entertaining in the air as I had hoped for all those years. And yes, the ersatz racing number on the rudder does represent its total time between building the airframe and its first flight.
<p>
For those who want to build their own favorite Clancy Bee, there is great news afoot. Andy Clancy is returning to the model airplane market! He has updated his previous kits with laser cut parts and revised building manuals, and has several new designs in development.
