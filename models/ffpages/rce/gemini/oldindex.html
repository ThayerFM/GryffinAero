It was built entirely of spruce and plywood, and spanned 36 feet, 2 inches.Powered by a pair of 100 hp Blackburn Cirrus Minor II engines, the Geminioffered comfortable and efficient transportation for up to four people at a max criuse of 145 miles per hour. Full fuel range was approximately 1000 miles, making it a perfect ship for touring the British Isles and the Continent. 170 aircraft were built, with many still surviving.</p><p>This model was built from the short-lived Klass Wings laser cut kit designed and sold by Keith Sterner.It is powered with a pair of stock S-400 motors turning Graupner's 6.5x4 scale propellers. </p><p>With all apologies to the scale police, I did mine up in an "undocumented" scheme using SIG Aerokote Lite. Assuming that this would be an ideal aircraft for a proper English gentleman to use for weekend touring with his lady, I tried to keep it tasteful, while still allowing that it might also go racing from time to time.</p><p><center><img src="gemini_18726.jpg" width=600 height=229><br><b>NEAT Fair 2005</b></center></p><p>I built my model in 2005 and had a great time flying loose formation with Keith at the <a href="http://www.neatfair.org" target="new">NEAT Fair</a> that fall.Originally I had great plans for plug-in landing gear to save the weight of retracts. Then then I realized I fly almost exclusively off grass, and already have a lot of planes for touch and goes. The only major modification I made was to the rear turtledeck. I doubled the stringer count to get the spacing more in line with those on the nose. I also replaced the vacuum formed nose bowls withones made from balsa, for a better fit and to use the same covering for a perfect color match.</p><p>For those who missed it, the NEAT Fair was great this year as well. Near perfect weather with light and variable breezes all weekend. I got another couple of flights on my Gemini, and it was the only one there that I noticed.</p></td></tr></table></p><p><table width=300 border=0><tr><td align=right>Wing Span:</td><td><font color=white>.</font></td><td>40 in.</td></tr><tr><td align=right>Weight:</td><td><font color=white>.</font></td><td>20.6 oz.</td></tr><tr><td align=right>Battery:</td><td><font color=white>.</font></td><td>Kokam 4S 910mAh Li-Poly</td></tr><tr><td align=right>Power:</td><td><font color=white>.</font></td><td>95 W/lb full throttle</td></tr><tr><td align=right>Duration:</td><td><font color=white>.</font></td><td>20+ minutes</td></tr></table><p><img src="kw_gemini_0505.jpg" width=500 height=203><br>I was fortunate to fly this Klass Wings prototype in the fall of 2004</p><p><img src="kw_gemini_0530.jpg" width=500 height=221 align=center><br>Keith Sterner and his wife Annette show off the Klass Wings prototypes</p><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="30%"><P><a href=../rce.html>Return</a><P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="50%"><P>Copyright 2006, <a href=mailto:thayer@gryffinaero.com>Thayer Syme</a>.
