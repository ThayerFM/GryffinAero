<p>As you can see, there isn't a lot of extra room in the fuse.  I designed it around the gear I had on hand, and actually made it a bit too narrow for my rx.  More on that later.  From left to right, we have the following.  4x110ma sanyo cells.  3/32" phono plug charge jack/switch (glued into hatch cover), Futaba Attack receiver (sans case), FMA S-80 servos for elevator, and rudder via sliding tray.
<p>
<B>Modifications to the radio gear</B>.  When I measured the thickness of the radio gear, as well as my fingers, I decided on 3/4" as a suitable inside dimension for width.  What I hadn't measured was the clearance needed for the leads when plugged into the rx.  Of course I didn't notice this until the fuse was framed up!  To make it all fit, I removed the connector block from the rx, and considered hardwiring pigtails to the board.  As that would have added a few grams of unnecessary weight, I modified the original design.  Removing 8 pins from the connector block, I soldered them directly to the circuit board.  So far, this seems to be okay, but I am being careful.  A stock Futaba servo connector has about 1/16" of plastic before the metal sleeves begin.  Trimming this plastic gave me a bit more clearance.  Oh yeah, it also saved some weight.  :-)
<p>
Speaking of weight, the original wire on the servos was long and heavy.  I replaced the stock leads with spare Futaba leads, shortened to a practical minimum.  This dropped the weight of the servos to about 8.5 grams.  Another place to save some weight is the Futaba antenna.  It is a bit heavier than necessary.  A gram or so can be saved by using lighter wire.  As the antenna is buried in the wing, a small pigtail with a single pin connector is all that remains of the original rx antenna.
<P>
The rudder servo had mounting lugs trimmed, and pieces of tubing CyA'ed onto the sides of the case.  There was no weight gain.  The rails for the sliding tray are 1/32" carbon rod, press fitted in place to allow later removal.
