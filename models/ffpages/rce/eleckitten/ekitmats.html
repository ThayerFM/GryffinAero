The following materials and supplies are recommended to complete your Electric Kitten short kit.
<p>All dimensions are in inches, and all material is full length 36-inch balsa stock, unless noted, with firm, straight stock recommended throughout to prevent warping.

<tr><td colspan=3><br>Cut LE & TE center sections from scrap. You will need about 3 inches of each.
<p>
With care, the spars and joiners can be cut from a single 3x36 sheet of firm, straight 1/8 balsa. Measure lengths carefully from plans before committing. TE can be cut from same sheet stock as fuselage sticks.

<tr><td colspan=3><br>
I recommend stripping sticks from sheet stock for consistency and cost savings. A single 3x36 sheet will nominally yield 24 1/8 square sticks if using a razor type stripper with no kerf. The extra stock allows you to be picky, or replenish your supplies for the next model. Using a table saw may waste up to half of the stock as dust, so plan accordingly.

<tr><td colspan=3><br>
I recommend extending the spreader bars to 13 1/4. Doing so will widen the float stance from 8 3/8 to 12 inches center to center, and increase stability on the water. Spreading the struts will also lower the fuselage about 5/8 of an inch. I lengthened my struts about an inch between the fuselage and floats to maintain the original thrust line height above the float decks. I have logged about 7 hours with the Kitten during the 2019 flying season, and no longer feel that lengthening the struts to accommodate the extra spacing is necessary.
<p>
<p>* - Both landing gear struts and the wing attach pin can be cut from a single piece of 1/16 music wire. I recommend buying two, just in case.
<p>** - Soldering small washers to the axles can replace the inner wheel collars.

<tr><td colspan=3><br>
The Dubro pushrod kit is a simple solution, but not required. The plans show pushrods made from 1/8 sq balsa & wire ends. My Electric Kitten has button thread runs for pull-pull control on the rudder.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=3>Himax 2812-0850, APC 8x6E prop, 18-25 amp ESC, 3S 700-1200mAh LiPo</td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#ffffff>QQ</font></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=3>
There is no need for extra power, 100 watts is more than enough. Our AXI powered Kitten easily lifts off glassy water at less than half stick, as does Carl's Himax powered version. We know of two Electric Kittens that still fly regularly on wheels and floats near Denver, with well-used Speed 400 brushed motors. Yes, that's roughly just 50 watts of power, at nearly 5000 feet ASL.

<p>Similarly, <em>please</em> don't weigh your model down with larger batteries. The recommended combinations have logged flight times in excess of 30 minutes. Do you really need more?
