Below are a few thoughts on building the W.29 kit available through the <a href="https://store.flying-models.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=9999" target="fmps">Flying Models plan service</a>.

<b>ASSORTED BUILDING NOTES</b>
<p>

This airframe builds quite quickly. The fuselage has only a few parts, and the wings come nearly ready to mount to the fuselage. Experienced builders should be able to complete it in a few short evenings. The primary challenge when building the W.29 is sequencing the painting steps within the build. The wings and tail surfaces must be painted before installation on the fuselage due to the masking required. More on that below. The fuselage can be painted just before installing the wings and tail.
<p> 
Watching Devin McGrath assemble his kit at the 2021 NEAT Fair taught me a new trick. His approach was so obviously logical that I will recommend it to all without reservation. Devin's first step on the fuselage was to glue the lite ply servo tray and firewall together, using the down thrust gauge included, and then install the motor, servos, receiver and ESC. Once all the gear was installed he set that module aside, and started in on the foam.
<p>

<p>
I developed a paint making system that brings the hex camo lozenge and markings well within the range of the average modeler. All of the original 13 models that made up the Class of 2021 were finished using cans of spray paint, and cardstock paint masks.
<p>
The motor and radio gear for such a model is quite basic and light weight, ensuring a very low wing loading.
<p>
The laser cut kits are set up for a specific Cobra motor, Hitec servos, and Dubro pushrods, as noted below.
<p>
This document is a collection of informative notes and musings, based on building and flying my model, Chris Parent's two prototypes, and the 10 other W.29s that made up the group build at the 2021 NEAT Fair.

<b>
Painting the Floats
</b>
</p><p>
The floats are CNC cut from XPS foam, typically used as building insulation. Because the Finished W.29 is so light, the floats can be finished by just coating with Liquitex acrylic paint. This paint provides a reasonably durable skin, that is both easy to apply, and easy to touch up. I recommend applying multiple thin coats with a foam brush. <b>DO NOT</b> thin the paint, just brush it out well, and let it dry. You can build up increased durability with multiple coats on the bottom of the floats, but the sides and top can be finished with just a couple of coats. Remember, paint can be heavy, so think twice about adding more coats once the foam is hidden.

Installing the Power and Radio Component
</b>

</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, Devin McGrath's technique of installing the power and radio components before gluing the the servo tray and firewall into the fuselage sides is much easier than trying and allows full access for

For reference, my W.29 weighs just 7.27 ounces without a battery, but otherwise ready to fly. A 2S pack around 800mAh brings that weight to 9 ounces as you advance the stick to take off.

<b>POWER & GUIDANCE</b><br>
There is no reason to put more than 50 watts into the power system, or load down the W.29 with a large battery.

The radio requirements for the W.29 are modest and the radio tray is laser cut for a pair of Hitec HS-55 servos. A light receiver can be stuffed under the tray as I did, or you can use double stick tape or velcro to secure it to the servo tray.
<p>
Chris Parent discovered that the W.29 is extremely maneuverable on the water with full rudder deflection, though it is best to limit the throw to about half of that for flying. Chris programmed his transmitter to 

The advantage of programming both sticks instead of using dual rates is that you can't accidentally take off with too much control throw.
 
My control throws are currently set as noted on this chart, and will be a good place to start. Chris and I both marveled at how well all the models flew at the NEAT Fair, despite the inevitable variance of throws and CG location.

<b>DETAILS</b>
<p>
There is plenty of room to accommodate personal preferences, with this model. Just remember, it isn't actually a scale model. It is just a goofy looking sport flyer that happens to bear a passing resemblance to an unusual WWI fighter.

<b>IN THE AIR</b>
<p>
Most of my water flying is a series of circuits around the pattern, searching for that perfect "pitter-patter" return to the water. That said, the W.29 is also quite capable of the typical three-channel shenanigans, especially if you increase the throws as you gain familiarity with it.

Like many smaller models, the W.29 won't dent your wallet too badly, and makes a great quick build between more complex projects. Most importantly, It is great fun to fly, and is unlike pretty much anything else you might shake out of a box. Give it a try, and remind yourself why so many say <i>"Fly Light, Fly Right!"</i>
