Adhesives - We were using foam-safe CA at NEAT, and it has been a good option. Chris and I tried using foamtac on the prototypes, and for some reason it was eating the floats, and even the depron to a lesser degree.

Finishing - You will need to think about this before you get started. Unless you are planning a plain gray scheme with minimal markings, it is best to paint the flying surfaces before installation, and indeed, before crimping the wing camber.

The fuselage should be assembled before painting, so you can to hide the seams as much as possible. Some may want to fill cracks and holes with a lightweight filler. You will want one that sands easily, and be sure you use a fine grit paper on a sanding block, to avoid furrowing your fuselage sides.

As for paint, we found that Krylon Fusion, long regarded as foam friendly, was still attacking the depron if the initial coat was too generous.  Lightly misting the bare part with Fusion would allow the color to bond, but without giving the foam a bad case of the pox. Krylon ColorMax gave similar results, and demanded similar attention and restraint.

A third option, and my favorite, is Tamiya Color for plastics. It did not seem to attack the foam at all, and also has a wide range of suitable colors available. The primary drawback is that it costs significantly more than the Krylon.

Standard Markings - Black & White

Hex Camo - 3 colors of your choice. Yes, you can leave the raw white depron color as one of them.

Clear Doped Linen. I sprayed the underside of my wings a tan color to start, to suggest the full scale structure was raw fabric with a few coats of dope. 

That should get you stared


If you are interested in doing a hex camo scheme, you will need  or a plain solid color?


Speaking of sanding, be very careful not to scar the foam with sandpaper.

The fuselage goes together quite quickly. Start by adding the two formers to one of the sides, and then adding the second side to them. Next, I would join the fuselage sides at the tail. Before doing that though, ensure that the sides are tapered, and that said tapers will mate on the inside of the fuselage. Once you have established some dom


One of the most distinctive features of the HB W.29 is the forest of struts securing the floats to the airframe. Breaking the forest down into a pair of sub assemblies will make this seemingly difficult task go much more quickly than you might imagine. Let's get started, shall we?

The two strut sub-assemblies consist of 6 pieces of carbon fiber rod. The single longest piece becomes the horizontal float spreader bar, and is labeled D-E in the accompanying sketch. The single shortest piece nests against the bottom of the fuselage and is labeled A-B. Separating these are two matched pairs. The longer pair are the outer pieces A-D and B-E, while the shorter pair makes up the central V, labeled A-C-B. 

These sub-assemblies are joined using sections of heat shrink tubing, cut to lengths of approximately 3/4 inch.
