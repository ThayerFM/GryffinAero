The B-314 Lazy Clipper got another try this morning.  I have repaired all the wing damage sustained in 1996 and reworked a few other details.

The elevator was lifted about 1/2" at the leading edge to help counter the violent pitch up previously noted.  The battery got 4 more cells, from 14 to 18, and the 3.8:1 Leisure gear boxes were replaced with the Astro 4.36:1 super boxes. Current draw went from 19 amps at full throttle to about 22. It weighed around 6 pounds.

Taxi trials this morning indicated that the stab incidence increase was probably a little extreme.  I could force the model up on the step, but it was difficult.  The model wanted to plow through the water, or perhaps even submerge the nose a little.  This had not been the case at all on previous attempts.

Yaw excursions were still excessive, and I am now considering mocking up a new pair of vertical surfaces with 50-75% more area.

Further updates will be made as appropriate.
