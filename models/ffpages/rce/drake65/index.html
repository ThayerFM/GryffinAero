The Fred Reese designed Electric Kitten has been one of my favorite models to fly over the last few years. At just under a pound, its low weight and wing loading allow a mesmerizing slow motion flight envelope, perfect when paired with the calm conditions often found around sunrise and sunset.

</p><p>

Musing how similar construction might enhance other designs, I recently decided to revisit one of my all time favorites. Ken Willard's 0.15-powered Drake II first appeared in the October 1980 issue of Model Aviation, and instantly captivated me. I enlarged the original 48-inch plans slightly to 54 inches and got to work immediately. The larger size was intended to provide a new home for an Enya 19 that had served in my original trainer.

</p><p>

I've built three Drakes of different sizes over the years, and apparently my fascination was not unique. The Drake II has remained one of the most popular plans ever published by the AMA.

</p><p>

My goal for this version was to keep it as light as possible, mimicking the feathery wing loading of the Electric Kitten. An hour or so with a spreadsheet convinced me that replacing the original's all sheet construction with a much lighter stick structure would allow me to meet the AMA park flyer guideline of a 2 pound max weight, while also enlarging the span to 65 inches.

</p><p>

My original 54-inch Drake was built over 40 years ago for the 1981 summer flying season. It has flown with both an OS 25 and 30, in addition to the original Enya 19. It is currently semi-retired, as the original Monokote needs replacing.

</p><p>

Built in 2007, the Micro Drake was my second version, and was construct entirely from sheet foam. It spans 15.75 inches, and weighs just 17.5 grams.

</p><p>

My most recent Drake build dates to 2008. It spans 23.8 inches, and was built using the now discontinued Park Scale Models kit.

Like the Electric Kitten, most of my flying with the Drake is a series of circuits around the pattern, trying to perfect my waterings. I seem to be averaging just over 4 amps, and I typically change the packs somewhere around 20 minutes, to avoid getting stranded off shore. With a smaller pack, the weight is below two pounds, and it is that much slower in the air.
