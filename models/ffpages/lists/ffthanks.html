Before your subscription is complete, you will need to verify that you actually want to subscribe.  This is for list and personal security purposes.  
<p>
Two email messages will be sent to you.
<p>
<center>
The first will be a List Manager response like this example.
<br>(data in italics will be different based on each request)
<table width=490 border=10>
<tr><td bgcolor=#55aa99>
From: ffml-request@airage.com
<br>To: <em>youraddress@yourserver</em>
<br>Subject: List Manager response
<br>Reply-To: ffml-request@airage.com

<p>>>>>subscribe
<br>Security settings for this list require address verification.
<br>Therefore, this request cannot be performed until address 
<br>verification is received.  
<p>
A verification request has been sent to the subscription address.  
<br>That message includes authorization information that must be sent 
<br>to the list request address.  Specific instructions are included 
<br>in the message.
</table>
Ignore this message, and look for the next one.
</center>
<p><hr width=35%>
<p>
The second message, and the one you care about, is an address verification request that does need a response.  It will contain four command lines and  look something like this.
<p>
