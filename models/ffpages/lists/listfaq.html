<B>List Hosting:</B> FFML hosting moved to Groups.io on December 8, 2020, and is known there as <a href="https://groups.io/g/ffml" target="ffmlnew">Free Flight Mailing List</a>.
<p> Most questions should be answered by information on the group home page linked above. If not, feel free to contact me via the group owner link on that page.
<p>
The day to day administration tasks are being handled on a volunteer basis.  When emotions heat up on the list, the necessary wrist slapping takes more time from an already busy day.  The more civil the postings, the more modeling I can do.
<p>

Since the hosting change is brand new, this page will be updated as time allows. In the meantime, welcome to the Free Flight Mailing List, founded October 1996.

<p><hr width =35%><p>

<B>Appropriate List Content:</B> FFML is for the discussion of flying model airplanes and topics related to such.  Discussion of model aviation, full sized aircraft and historical information is appropriate. Discussion of religion, politics, personal attacks and profanity is not.  There are hundreds of subscribers world wide, and not everyone will share the same ideas of modeling, let alone what is appropriate language or politics.  Use common sense in your postings, and consider how you would feel receiving them through the anonymity and emotionless presentation email allows. Subscriptions are provided at the discretion of the list administrative staff.  Occasionally we have had to forcibly remove or warn list participants for grievous deviations from polite discussions about model airplanes.  Don't be the next person dropped or disciplined.
<p>

<B>FFML Content:</B> All manners of Free Flight are discussed and are welcome within the FFML.  Subscribers have experience with ultralight indoor duration as well as sport and scale FF models powered with rubber, electric, CO<sub>2</sub>, glow, diesel, compressed air and rocket motors.  There are also messages about handlaunched, catapult and towline gliders.  Model size or complexity is not important.

<p><hr width =35%><p>

<B>Quoting Previous Messages:</B> Responding to previous messages will usually require some quoted text to help maintain continuity of the discussion topic.  Please, oh please, limited this quoting to the absolute minimum necessary.
<p>All too many folks quote an entire message back to the list, often only adding one or two lines of additional content.  For folks subscribed to the digest, this might mean resending an entire digest back to the list along with your response.  How wasteful, especially when you remember that many subscribers pay for email by volume.  Usually a requoted digest is too large, gets bounced to the list admin, and never arrives on the list at all.

If you would like to subscribe to this list, carefully read and follow the below instructions.  There is also an <A HREF="listfaq.html"><B>F.A.Q.</B></A> that provides additional information for subscribers.
<p>
<hr size=2 width="50%">
<p>
There are 2 versions of the list available, both containing the same info. You must choose one or the other.  You can't subscribe to both options from the same address.
<p>
<B>Option A, the regular mail list:</B> This option will send out the individual messages as they are received by the list server.  The main advantage is that messages can be sorted and sifted within your email application to better suit your own modeling needs and preferences.
<p>
<B>Option B, Digest Format:</B>  The digest option sequences many individual messages as they come in. They are grouped into a single larger message which is then sent out at least once a day or after a digest accumulates about 30K of text.  This option is preferred by many modelers getting personal email at work.

<table width=590 border=0>
<tr><td>
<p>
<B>Subscribing / Unsubscribing:</B>  This is often a mystery for folks.  To ease the pain, I have posted links below.  They are the easiest way to subscribe and to control your delivery mode. Just click on the appropriate link below.
<p>
All subscription requests need to be sent to
<br><em><a href="mailto:ffml+subscribe@groups.io">ffml+subscribe@groups.io</a></em>
<p>
The address is  different to unsubscribe.
<br><em><a href="mailto:ffml+unsubscribe@groups.io">ffml+unsubscribe@groups.io</a></em>
<p>
<a href="https://groups.io/g/ffml" target="new">Click here</a> to visit the FFML home page and manage your subscription.

<p><hr width =35%><p>


<B>Delivery Modes:</B> There are 2 versions of the list available, both containing the same info. You must choose one or the other.  You can't subscribe to both options from the same address.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<B>Option A, the regular mail list:</B> With this option messages are delivered to subscribers as they are received by the list server.  The main advantages of this format are that messages are delivered more quickly, and they can be sorted, sifted, saved, printed and deleted individually within your email application to suit your own needs and preferences.
<p>
<li><B>Option B, Digest Format:</B>  The digest option sequences many individual messages as they come in. They are grouped into a single larger message which is then sent out at least once a day or after a digest accumulates about 30K of text.  This option is preferred by many modelers getting personal email at work.
<p>
<li>
<B>Changing your Delivery Mode:</B> The list home page has links to allow you to control your desired delivery options. Click to jump to the <a href="https://groups.io/g/ffml" target="ffmlnew">Free Flight Mailing List.</a> home page.
</ul>
</ul>

<p><hr width =35%><p>

<B>Unexpected Unsubscribes:</B> The list software automatically deletes anyone whose address bounces mail back to the server as undeliverable. It does this as a self-preservation technique to keep the disks from filling up with bounced mail. They would fill up VERY quickly if it didn't do this.
<p>
I cannot set the list not to do this.  It is an integral feature of the software used. If your address bounces mail you're likely to get deleted. I have found that the 'free' e-mail services like hotmail.com and yahoo.com have more service interruptions than a server like AOL. People with mail accounts at these places tend to complain more often of getting booted.
<p>
Again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but it's part of being able to make the lists continue to run smoothly.


<A NAME="address"></a>
<center><a href="#top"><IMG SRC="1up.gif"  WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=10></a></center>
<p><hr width =35%><p>

<B>Posting from Other Addresses / Delayed Postings:</B> These two issues are essentially the same topic.  Only messages from subscribed addresses are allowed on FFML.  This is to prevent undesired spam from flooding the mailing lists.  Any message from an unsubscribed address are rejected by the server.
<p>
Usually these messages are from subscribers whose email addresses have changed, often without their knowledge.  If your system admin changes your address you will not be able to post directly to the mailing list, despite continuing to receive mail.  This usually occurs when software is updated or a new server is installed.  If your address is <em>you@host.com</em> and it becomes <em>you@mailserver.host.com</em>, your ability to post will be compromised.
<p>
Similarly, if you are using a second email service to forward your mail to another address, you will likely experience problems.  I recommend that you subscribe any address from which you are likely to post messages.  If you subscribe secondary addresses to the digest, you can easily delete them at will or maintain a personal archive.
