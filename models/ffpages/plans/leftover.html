Subject: Plan for a foamwing glider
<P>Here is a plan for a little (30sq.in.) glider made with meat tray foam wings.  It's not designed to any rule.

We were out of balsa and while they were building balsa wings, I....well, you get the picture.

This plan should print on a single sheet of letter sized paper.  Note the scale in the lower left, and enlarge or reduce to suit.
