Durability was the goal here, with any duration a side benefit. I managed to achieve both. The prototype has been flow extensively and, despite his best efforts, has required only a couple of repairs in the last seven years. The carbon fiber outlines, durable covering, and robust fuselage stick have provided a lasting model that can easly fly for a minute in calm air.</p><p>Duncan's initial launching technique was to hold the model and prop with two hands, walk out to an appropriate launching position in the gym, then put the model on the floor. As he did this, he would collapse the landing gear enough to stop the prop against the floor, release the prop and then release the model. The gear would rebound, allowing the prop to turn and the model to R.O.G. Such technique depends on a durable model that can bounce back, and fortunately this one can.</td></td><td valign="bottom"><img src="planpdfs/purlone/17727.jpg"><br><font size=-1>Maximum durability is the goal with this design, to keep the smiles coming.

As promised, I have finalized the plan for this model, hereafter known as the "Purl-One" and offer it here. Thank you to all who voted. Photos of Gryffin in his knit wear will appear as soon as I can take the photos and upload them.</p><p>Below are links to a series of PDFs.
