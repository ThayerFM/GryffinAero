The Phantom Flash is a simple rubber powered ROG (Rise Off Ground) model, suitable for clubs hosting one design indoor low key competitions.
<p>
All necessary building notes will be found on the plan.  Unfortunately there is scant detail about the propeller.  A suitable balsa prop can be carved, or built from sheet.  A 6 or 7" diameter prop would be a good start.  Alternatively, a "commercial" plastic prop can be used. These can be found in many hobby shops separately, or as part of a beginner's model.  I would recommend agressively scraping the prop with a razor blade to lighten it.
<p>
Additional building advice can be found in the <a href="../contacts/mac/macinfo.html">Introduction to Building and Flying Free Flight Model Aeroplanes</a>.
<p>
Before building the plan may need to be enlarged. The wing span should be 16 1/4" as indicated.
