<P>FF: F1B wakefield. This is my main interest in modelling. Been flying in international contests since 1984. I also fly F1H, F1J, P-30 and HLG - more or less occasionally
<br>Indoor: I fly F1D-beginner (almost like pennyplane) and Peanut, also have tried No-Cal and LRS. But F1DB is most interesting - with all aerodynamics involved.
<br>RC: 2-meter glider to national rules (mostly rudder-elevator control only). I also fly 1/2A power models, if I have time and one happens to be in flying condition!
<br>home made wine, science fiction

<br>System Safety Engineer (30 years with the US Navy and Marine Corps; specializing in RPVs/UAVs, aerial target systems and various weapon systems)

<br>Interested in ALL types and categories of models, but currently trying to narrow the competition focus to F1J, the AMA-Gas events, P-30, Coupe, Mulvihill; might even drag out an old F1A once in a while. Fascinated by flying machines with loooonnngg wings or unusual configurations (flying wings, canards). I have even been spotted occassionally with an RC glider.  And some day, when I get a Round Tuit, I want to do rubber scale.

<br>Other: kites, auto racing, travel, photography, sailplanes, full-size aviation; passing interests in tropical fish, ponds, astronomy, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Like Chris Holford, I'm looking for interesting employment. I want to retire and find a different line of work and a different place to live (somewhere south of here and near a decent flying site). After 30 years, it's time to do something different someplace else.

<br>I mess around with a bunch of different things. Have been flying indoors for a while. Last winter I built the first EZB I've been able to get to a competitive weight, though I need a new, non-pretzel stab for it. Best flight 14:48 but not anywhere near the ceiling. Also, finally got an FAC style airplane to fly well, pretty much an outdoor plane. This is a Golden Age Seversky done as the S2 racer.  Seem to collect lots of cute scale kits.  Have particular weakness for Wildcat, and Puss Moth.  Also mess with catapult glider (elbow trashed). 
<br><br>I'm interested in flying wings, and have some ideas for rubber powered versions of same. Might do an N1M someday, was also thinking of a Horten Parabel with a clear prop, but local CD thinks this is bogus (it was a glider). I think it would be different from other golden age planes.
<br><br>Also do rc hand launch (actually with a short high start) and rc thermal gliders. Have a powered plane almost ready but can't bring myself to mess with it. 
<br><br>other interests: Have become interested in soaring, and in particular ultralight soaring. Have fantasy of building something that looks like Backstrom Plank but light enough to be Part 103 legal (US ultralight glider, 155 lbs max). Probably all fantasy at the moment because I build so little.  Recently attended Flying Wing Symposium and Sailplane Homebuilders Workshop, which was fairly entertaining.

<br>I like 'em all but especially SMALL r/c. Been flying Bostonians and hanging around with some f/f folks of late.  Like small electric f/f.  Started a club (North East Florida Flyers) 4 years ago that caters to all kinds of model aviation; basic premise is that modeling of any kind is FUN! Write the "FLIGHT SCHEDULE" monthly. Member of the Gateway R/C Club. I enjoy teaching kids about our hobby and have done regular classes and demos for them.
<br>Family=wife & 2 daughters + grandson (4 yrs old).  
<br>Aviation, sailing, photography, collect 3 views/av. books/av. magazines/model plans, kits and for some strange reason, I started sticking the little fruit labels up on the 
kitchen cabinet one day and now I have a collection of those too.
