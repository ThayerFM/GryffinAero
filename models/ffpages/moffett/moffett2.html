<p>
Indoor model flying at Moffett Field has been suspended indefinitely due to a recently discovered problem with lead contamination in the floor and walls.  All personnel have been moved out, including those of the Airship Museum.
<p>
It will cost approximately three million dollars to decontaminate it.
<br>No one knows where the money will come from.
<p>
Updated information will be posted here if and when it becomes available.

<P>George Xenakis of the Oakland Cloud Dusters has arranged monthly flying sessions in Hangar One at NASA/Ames Moffett Field.

<P>35 miles south of San Francisco, Hangar 1 at Moffett Field was home to the grand Navy dirigible, U.S.S. Macon.  Hangar 1, completed in 1933, measures inside at 1133 feet long, 308 wide, and 198 high.  As large as that seems, the Macon missed the walls by just 6-12 feet!!  More recently the hangar has been used by NASA for maintenance and other needs.  Now it seems that after 3 decades, there will again be regular indoor Free Flight sessions in this world class facility.

<P>Despite the quality of this site, it will not be restricted to modelers with years of experience.  Indeed, anyone with an interest in flying models is welcome.  Come on out, ask a question or two, and join the ranks of modelers who have discovered the magic of indoor Free Flight. 

<P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="75%">

<P>Where:  Hangar One, NASA/Ames Moffett Field, Mountain View, California.

<P>When:  Saturdays - the third Saturday of each month

<P>Time:  Flying will be from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

<P>Purpose:  Test flying to adjust models to maximize their flight duration.  Experienced modelers will be there to help.  Some kits and building materials will be available.

<P>Contests:  Instead of test flying, contests will be flown on two Saturdays, March 21st and October 17th.  These days will include Delta Dart and Penny Plane events and others to be announced.  Similar to the <A HREF=ddpp.html>October 1997 contest</A>, rules and info will be available at least two months before each contest.

<P>Admission:  Free - But email George Xenakis at:<A HREF="mailto:geoxen@aol.com">geoxen@aol.com</a> to get your name on the NASA Main Gate admissions roster - One request covers admittance to any one or all of the flying sessions.
