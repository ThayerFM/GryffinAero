<H2>Model Airplane Contest</H2>
<H3>Hangar One, Moffett Field </H3>

<P>Though this event has long since come and gone, it was a great day, and a very successful format.  Similar contests were held twice a year at Moffett until its recent closure. I would recommend it to anyone considering a local event to stir interest in Model Aviation.  In addition to the events contested, many local modelers came to help, as well as demonstrate other FF models.  We enjoyed flights of Free Flight scale models, gliders, helicopters, and several duration classes.  Power sources of models demonstrated included rubber, electric, and CO2 as well as rubber catapults for the gliders.  At least one participant has gone on to start other models, much more complex than those he flew at the contest.  I expect that he will not be alone, in his new found hobby.
