<P>Deciding to reduce my library a bit, I thought I would offer up these volumes for sale.  They are in excellent condition, and in many cases, just extra copies that I have on hand.  If for any reason you are not satisfied, I will be glad to refund your full purchase price.  Shipping and handling will be billed at actual cost.
