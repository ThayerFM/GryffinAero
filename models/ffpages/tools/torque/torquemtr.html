Changes in temperature and humidity will affect the maximum turns possible much more than the torque.  You also can get a real insight to the available power when winding with a torque meter.<p>Some modelers will build their own meters, while others choose to buy.  Meters can be mounted on a winder, or attached to a solid surface.  Torque meters have also been designed as winder extensions for use with a blast tube.<ul><li><a href=jonestrq.html>Fixed Meter</a> from Jim Jones<li><a href=../winder/winder.html#wilder>Winder mounted meter</a> from Bob Wilder<li><a href=tmeter.html>Build your own</a> - Drawings, thoughts and tips<li><a href=torquetech.html>Torque Meter Tech Talk</a> - More tips on building and using meters</ul></table><P><a href=../tools.html>return</a><p><hr size=2 width=50%><p>Copyright 1999-2016, <a href="mailto:thayer@gryffinaero.com">Thayer Syme</a>.
