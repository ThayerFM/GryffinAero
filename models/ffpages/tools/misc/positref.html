<TD>Sometimes the simplest tools are the most useful.  How many times have you struggled with a ruler, measuring a model to see if the dihedral was equal, or if the stab is crooked?  Shown on the right is a little position indicator that I made in just a few minutes out of some hard balsa sticks a scrap of sheet and some super glue.
<p>
The arm is made of two sticks with the ends glued together.  It slides up and down on the upright and is held in place by friction. Not seen is a second arm that is handy when rigging biplanes, or checking total throw of a control surface.
<p>
The bolt is there as a weight, to keep the device from tipping over.  Wouldn't want to damage a delicate structure, in this case the stabilizer of my <A HREF="../../models/ff2/famoth.html">Flying Aces Moth</A>.
<p>
There isn't too much else to say about it, except that it is one of the most used tools on my bench. If you build one, you might well agree.
