<P>
Quickly fashioned with a scrap of plywood and a bit of wire from the local hobby shop, this scale is very handy at the flying site for checking weights of motors.  If you are lucky enough to find a copy of Ron Williams out of print book, "Building and Flying Indoor Model Airplanes", there is a set of construction notes enclosed.  A glance at the picture ought to be enough for most modelers as well.  Note the end of the wire is bent with a hook, as well as a bracket to hold stripwood.  The "foot" pivots on a metal pin to fold out of the way for storage.
<P>
Calibration is done with known reference weights.  Capacity and resolution are functions of wire diameter, length, and your own patience with the reference weights.  FWIW, mine has a length of 0.015 music wire about 6" long and a max capacity of 2 grams.
