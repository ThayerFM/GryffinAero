<blockquote>
Long time fans of <A HREF="http://hrunway.com" target="new">Bill Hannan's wonderful publications</A> have been treated to endless photos of delightful stick and tissue models over the years.  Among the finest have been those built by Jiro Sugimoto of Japan. Mr. Sugimoto is a meticulous craftsman with an uncompromising eye, and a very steady hand.  
<p>
The following photographs show four models he recently brought to the San Francisco Bay Area.  I have included several detail photos, as we rarely see models of this caliber in person.
<p>
I feel honored to have seen and photographed these exquisite models.  They are the image of grace in the air, circling gently and in perfect trim.

Jiro's Waco SRE is lighter than my 8 gram Demoiselle!  I could argue that the Dem
<br>was weighed with the CO<sub>2</sub> motor on board, but it has also never known an airbrush.
<p>
And now to his models ...

The detailing on the Moustique impresses the viewer with a strong sense of realism.

The motor appears to be built up of balsa, tubing and other bits.  I believe the pilot is carved foam, with wire framed goggles.
<p>
The "wire" rigging on the Moustique tail surfaces is thread, stiffened with white glue. The control horns were cardstock or 1/64" ply.

The longest flight to date has been 115 seconds on 1700 turns.

Despite drag from the large fuselage, radiator and struts, the Waterman just floats through the air.
<p>
I would like to think that the wheels had something to do with the success of this model. I know better, however, and am honored by their presence.
<p>
Thank you for visiting us, Sugimoto-san, however briefly. Your inspiration will be long lasting.
