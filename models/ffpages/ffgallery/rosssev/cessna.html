<p>"This is a picture of my Cessna 180, built from the Herr kit. 17-1/2", 
18 grams, fairly stock for a local laser cut contest. I did move the 
peg and use one of those adjustable nose blocks. Also, I ended up 
adding some more dihedral. Got it to fly left as I was flying indoors. 
Might have flown right with original dihedral, I think, but marginally. 
With stock prop and an attempt to keep weight to the front I ended 
up adding a lump of clay on the back. In the picture you can see the 
results of trying to trim to circle in a small room: no struts or landing 
gear fairings, and replacement tissue. The model is airbrushed 
white with Golden airbrush media, then the trim is color tissue. So 
far I have 41 seconds indoors, but more may be possible.

<p>"After I bought the kit I was in Elmira for the flying wing conference 
(workshop?) and the prototype buzzed the field and then landed 
where I could take pictures. The K model seems to have a window 
that is not in the kit.
