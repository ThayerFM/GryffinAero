"I also have a few more planes completed, a peanut Sopwith Pup, 16" Great Lakes, peanut Sommer Monoplane and I am now working on my own design of a peanut Bleriot. I try to never spend more than two weeks on a model, since I am always so anxious to fly them! Most of these planes were built since January 2001."
