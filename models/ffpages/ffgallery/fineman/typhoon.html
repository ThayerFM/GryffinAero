<h1>Mark Fineman's Typhoon</H1>

<p>Here's a nice looking WWII bird from Mark Fineman

<p>"Thayer: Here's the Typhoon photo I promised. I built it as an experiment (aren't they all?), mostly because I retained the canopy from the original kit and still had the plan. Built from the kit, it was no more than a so-so flyer, mostly because of the absurd airfoil supplied by Guillow. And yet the slab-sided Guillow kit is extremely simple and charming. <br>My modifications included:

<p>1. A stabilizer enlarged to 110% of the original. The fin/rudder was changed to a laminated bent-balsa construction. 

<p>2. The airfoil was changed to a Rhode-St. Genese 27, but everything else about the wing construction remained as per plan. 

<p>3. Extra lengths of stringer were added in the nose area to round out the fuselage, but otherwise it remains fairly flat-sided. 

<p>4. The prop is a North Pacific cut down to 5-inches. I no longer had the kit spinner and substituted a small, plastic Easter egg half. 

<p>5. Keeping with the greasy kid theme of the plane, I never got aournd to adding the cannon fairings or radio mast. 

<p>Oh yes, it is a much better flyer than the kit plane, but the glide is still quite a sight because the rubber peg remains in its original location, i.e., too far aft. Still, it looks like a Typhoon when airborne!"
