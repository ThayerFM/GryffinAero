Hi Thayer:
<p>
I just finished an Earl Stahl 33" Cessna 195 (Army L-126) and thought you might like to see it.  The photos were taken with a Sony Mavica, not the best resolution I'm afraid, but you'll get the idea. The model was literally completed last night and the pictures shot about an hour ago.  Ain't technology wonderful (when it works)?
<p> 
The plans originally appeared in the April 1950 M.A.N., and the model was intended for CO2 power.  My model will be rubber-powered.  The plans were quite good, although the cowl had to be redesigned to the proper shape.  The plan also showed no cowl bumps.
