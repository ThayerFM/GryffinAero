Here is my nephew Duncan, and a pair of gliders that he has just finished. I believe that they are the first flying models that he has made himself.
<p><A NAME="ant"></A>
The gliders are all sheet balsa construction and were built from a Swedish kit made by Run Johannson of ACKUS.  There are actually 3 models in the kit, but we only had time to build these two.  They were completed with very little assistance, and fly remarkably well.  The second picture shows a trimming flight in the front hall.
