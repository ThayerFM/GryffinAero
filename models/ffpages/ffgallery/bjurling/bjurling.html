<p>Hi Thayer!

<p>I have now signed up to the new (?) mailing list with indoor/slow fly radio control.

<p><a href=bjurling2.html>Me, and a couple of friends</a> have ordered quite a few Wespe kits (eleven to be exact!) from the German company "WES technic"  Mine is now finished and I have flown it outside my house, in the street lamps. In the middle of the night. This was my first Slowflyer, and I'm sure there will be more. I'm planning a two-motor version...
<br>WES homepage:<A HREF="http://www.idnet.de/homepage/scholl/">http://www.idnet.de/homepage/scholl/</a>

<p>My plane weighs 100 grammes. (3,5 ozs?) Using WES 3,5 grammes servos. I can climb about 45 degrees.  Flying time with a 7 cell 50mah pack is 4-5 mins. Attached you'll find a pic of my friend's Wespe. I was foolish enough to try to fly in far too windy conditions, so mine didn't make it to the camera... (It was fixed in half an hour though)

<p>Keep in touch!

<p><a href=bjurling2.html>more pix from Johan</a>

<p>Johan has posted a web site with some of his other models.  It is available in both <a href=http://hem1.passagen.se/johanbju>Swedish</a> and <a href=http://hem1.passagen.se/johanbju/index_eng.htm>English</a>.  Look for his tips on building a Wespe.  While specifically tailored to the kit, there is good info about building light and slow models.
