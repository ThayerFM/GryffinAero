I also used the Air Hog motor for a free flight model, a P-40 Warhawk.<p><tr><td><br><center><IMG SRC="p40ah.jpg"ALT="AirHog powered P-40"  WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300 ALIGN=TOP></center><tr><td><br>When this picture was taken, flight times were around 20 seconds. Since then I have significantly rebuilt the nose and chin, and flight times so far are  between 25 and 30 seconds.<p><CENTER>This more recent picture shows the modified chin.<p>Its best flight time to date is 33 seconds<p><IMG SRC="p40ah2.jpg" ALT="AirHog powered P-40"  WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=TOP></CENTER><p><tr><td><br> <blockquote><p><B>Wingspan: </B>26"<B><br>Weight: </B>3.5 oz. including motor/tank<B><br>Material: </B>blue foam fuselage and white foam everything else.</blockquote><p><tr><td><br>This is a work in progress.  I have modified it a number of times throughlessons learned with the Air Hogs motor.    I think the potential for thatmotor is tremendous.<p>The finish was done with waterbase paints and homemade printed "decals".  Ihave been experimenting with weathering and this is one of my test subjects.<p>The pilot is carved from white foam.  The cockpit detail is a color print ofa P-40 cockpit photo.  I couldn't do a 3D cockpit due to the position of theair tank.<p><A HREF="mailto:jadelongacre@netzero.net">Jacob</a></table><P><A HREF="is4.html">View Jacob's foam Nikitin Schevchenko IS-4</A>.<p><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=35%><p><a href=../ffgallery.html>gallery index</A> | <a href=../../../modelhp.html>home page</a><P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=50%><p>Copyright 1999, <a href=mailto:thayer@gryffinaero.com>Thayer Syme</a>.
