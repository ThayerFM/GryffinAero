The Globe Swift is from Earl Stahl's 1947 MAN plan enlarged to 25" span. The beefy TE was retained but planed from very light balsa, also used throughout. So it came out to about 50 grams with Trexler #1 airwheels, all up. I made slots in the wings and gave it the modern cabin look that most Swifts have, and had a lot of fun flying this plane, which was given away to an admirer after being thoroughly worn out and repeatedly repaired. I also did the Comet/Diels Swift at 20 and 25 inch sizes and had a lot of fun with them. Very light yet realistic looking. Red Esaki.
