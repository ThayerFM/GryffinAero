"The Jodel was designed to be a super-simple project, utilizing a flat wing airfoil cross-section.  I drew up  another version that has sliced  ribs, as well.  I rather like a modicum of engine detail, even on a profile model; I found a small piece of thin metallic gray sheet foam for the cylinder bank detail, and capped it off  with a dummy valve cover.  The exhaust pipes give the model just enough engine detail to look like a proper powerplant. This particular full scale subject used to be based at the Livermore, Ca. airport.  It was destroyed in a crash due to engine failure about 8-10 years ago.
<p>
The Mooney is based on a full-scale subject that is based in Ohio, that  attended the Mooney Mite  Fly-In in Porterville several years ago.  My model employs 3 laminated fuselage pieces: the upper and lower cowl outlines, and the tailcone tip. The Mooney engine details are comprised of 1/64th balsa valve covers, painted with a gel pen, affixed to a black Esaki tissue background/outline.
<p>
Both aircraft are constructed from 1/20th balsa stripwood and covered with Esaki.  The Mooney has 1/32nd sliced ribs. Mike Morrow's adjustable aluminum bearing holders work very nicely, and are coupled with a plastic "Butterfly" propeller. Power is supplied by 1/16th Peck rubber loops. Both models have FAC legal 16" wingspan."
