<p>This wonderful little model of Jason's is a delight to all who have seen it.  Very small and light, it still does fly, and very well, thank you.
<p>
It was built using the originals of the <A HREF="../../plans/twirp.html">twirp plans</A>, shrunk to size, and with wood reduced as appropriate.

I labled it 'Tiny Twirp' so that I could distinguish between photos of it and the 6" version. 

<P>It is an exact scaled ( 66% ) copy of the <A HREF="../../plans/twirp.html">Twirp on your page</A>. 
<br>Span - 4 inches
<br>Weight - 3/10 gram sans rubber.
<br>Rubber - anything from a single strand of .020 x 4.5" to a loop of .017
x 5" so far. Everything I've tried so far has worked.
<br>Prop - 2 lams of .01" sheet balsa formed over a carved mold and joined
to a turned down balsa spar. I don't recall the diameter, but it is what
is shown on the plan set to a pitch/diameter of 2 to 1.

<p>Duration - +/- 30 seconds.
<br>Top time - one minute, outdoors in the Marinwood parking lot :)

<p>Covering is c-paper on the fuse, Polymicro film on the flying surfaces.
Everything was airbrushed before covering with acrylic paint.
<p>
That's all I can think of right now.
<p>
Cheers,
