The MEE-KRO 280 (pronounced "me-krawh" in Spanish, meaning micro) is one of five models I designed around standard DC motors such as the Speed 280 and small Mabuchi N20 motors. This in conjunction with inexpensive construction materials and easy assembly techniques makes the Mee-Kro heli possible. 
<p>
This is a continuation of my ongoing passion for flying model electric helicopters. 
<p>
Micro Equipment consists of:
<br>Ceto FM 4-channel radio receiver. 
<br>Futaba FM Conquest FP-T5NLH radio transmitter with Rev. Mixing capability.

<br>Hobbico all-purpose piezo gyroscope for tail rotor stabilization 
<br>Two Hitec HS-50 micro servos fro pitch and roll control. 
<br>7-8 cell 250 milli-amp/hour rechargeable battery pack for +/- 5 minute flight  time for intermediate to expert flying. 
<br>12 Volt DC 4 amp/hour power source with trainer cord for novice flying.
<p>
