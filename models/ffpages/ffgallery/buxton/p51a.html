This photo is of my P-51A for P-nut scale.  The model was first place in FAC P-nut at the United States Indoor Champs this year in Johnson City.  Best flight so far is just over 2:20.  She weighs 4.5 grams, covered with white Sig Esaki tissue, sprayed with Floquil pigment.  Insignias are also cut from Sig white tissue sprayed the appropriate colors.  I drew the plans up from a Camouflage and Markings on AutoCAD.  <p>I am considering doing a construction article with plans and photos for Model Aviation if they would be interested.  I was kind of wondering if other builders would be as well.  Anyhow I hope you get this, and hope you can find room for it in your gallery.<p>~<A HREF="mailto:jim_buxton@ats-ohio.com">Jim</A></table><p>Check out Jim's <A HREF="ma2.html">Miss Ashley II</A> Peanut Scale Racer as well.<p>-Thayer<HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=35%><p><a href=../ffgallery.html>gallery index</A> | <a href=../../../modelhp.html>home page</a><P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=50%><p>Copyright 1999, <a href=mailto:thayer@gryffinaero.com>Thayer Syme</a>.
