Thayer,
<P>
I was very pleased to see your version of the <a href="../../models/ff2/aviette.html">1913 'Aviette'</a> which is my design!  You have done a very neat job and I was very impressed by the  cycling leg action idea.  Apart from 'what is that?', the most common  comment I get about my Aviette is 'why didn't you make the legs go  round?'. So now I can tell people that it is possible and that you have 
already done it!
<P>
My model's best time is about 28 secs, so congratulations on breaking the half minute barrier - and winning a competition too!

We have a very keen contingent of scale flyers here in South Australia who fly indoor once a month and at a variety of outdoor events throughout the year.  If you are interested in more information about our activities let me know.
<p>
Meanwhile, here are a couple of jpeg files:  The top image is a Spartan Cruiser.  At 29 inch span it's very big for me.  David Putterill joked that if I keep on at this rate I'll have to buy another sheet of balsa!  I'm still working on the trim.  It wants to spiral in whichever way I try to turn it.  It already has enlarged tail surfaces. I'll try increasing the wing washout and maybe even increasing the dihedral...
<p> 
Next is my Avia B.35 fighter (middle) and my 15 inch span WW1 Breguet 14B (in green).  The Bre 14 has a best indoor time of 49 secs.  The Avia is an outdoor model, a bit bigger, and a very fine flyer (though the glide needs some work...).
