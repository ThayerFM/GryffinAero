<H2 align=center>Treasures from Chris Parent</H2>
<P>
Here is some info from Chris on his newest scale masterpiece.
<br>(the pix are below the text)

<p>It is a Nakajima Type 91 scaled up to 1:18 from Nate Sturman's drawings. It flies precisely as advertised by Nate, very stable despite no dihedral and a very small stab.

<p>Basic specs: 
<ul>
<li>  39.99 gm. w/o rubber.
<li>  24" wingspan.
<li>  CG at 35% of chord (flies very slow, stable, consistent very weird)
<li>  incidence: Wing 3.5 deg. at root, 1.0 deg. at tip, Stab 0.0 deg.
<li>  ~1.5 deg. downthrust and ~2.0 right thrust (kind of a guess on the R thrust) for R/R pattern.
<li>  huge wing compared to the rest of the plane.
<li>  Spinner from a Guillows Spitfire. Guillows is local and will sell their vacuum formed parts over the counter for almost nothing.
<li>  Union (Pecks) 20cm prop thinned down for balance (the plane almost came out nose heavy)
<li>  5 strands of 1/8 rubber at 15%. I'll probably try 6 strands and more rubber weight for regular (non mass launch) flying.
<li>  White Japanese tissue colored gray with chalk. It looks much lighter in the pictures than it really is. The Photo Lab automatically lightened the pics due to the very dark paper background.
<li>  Markings are red tissue, black paper, and technical pens.
<li>  Wheels are the main gear from a Golden Age P-39 (My next project; I guess I'm building it gear up now.)
</ul>
Nate provided almost daily advice, research, etc. during the intense 2+ week build.
