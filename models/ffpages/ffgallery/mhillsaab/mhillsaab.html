<P>Marcus Hill, <A HREF="mailto:mlh3@nexus.mwsu.edu">mlh3@nexus.mwsu.edu</a>, has forwarded two pictures of his current Free Flight project. 

<P>"It is an electric ducted fan model of a SAAB J-21R in a bare bones condition.  There are two shots, one was done before I got all the pieces framed up but is a better angle than the other picture with all the pieces , I ran out of film at the critical moment. :-(     The model is a bit over 3 feet in span and weighs 13.5 ozs so far with the batteries and fan in place.  Power is a Red Flame Blaster and I'll use 5 270 Mah cells for power. 

<P>Hope it flies as good as it is starting to look. The next big hurdle is the canopy. Think I'll make it in pieces rather than try for a one piece affair, new ground for me there.

<P>Happy Holidays,
<br>Marcus Hill, Wichita Falls, Texas
