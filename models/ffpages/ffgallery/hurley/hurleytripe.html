<p>Yes, you may use my picture. I'd be honored. It'd be a fitting tribute to the plane that a few minutes later took off on the long trip West (well, South in this case). Actually, if I hadn't been showing-off I would never have lost it.

<p>It was July of 1995 at the SAM 27 old-time rubber yearly event. <a href=../../contacts/mac1.html>George Benson</a> and I were planning to fly 'cabins' in the under 150 sq." class. The wind was pretty much blowing out the contest, so we didn't fly them. I had brought the tripe to fly around to drum-up interest in including a Dime Scale class next year. (Didn't happen.) I knew the triplane would fly well in the wind, being about the most stable flyer I've ever had. As a lark, I entered it. My times weren't too bad. I was amused, while others seemed amazed. I was the one amazed, though, when it zoomed up and around going down wind fast, but NOT coming down. Six or so of us did a thorough search for a half mile or more on the path we'd all seen it take . . . OOS.

<p>I guess the real joke is that it took second place! My nanosecond of fame. And there are those that still talk of it. May your triplane do even better.

<p>It was from a Megow Models' dime kit plan. That is the only one in that class that has +incidence in the stab.(as far as I know). George Benson turned me onto an article on it in Aero Modeler, by Doug McHard. The scale is poor and I planned to fly it in peanut(11/34" span) so I set the mid-wing on the top longeron and adjusted it's length, made movable ailerons and rudder, and gave it a built-up spreader wing instead of 1/16" sheet. The nostalgia note is that that red/white checkered paper I used was scraps left over from what my brother stamped-up in 1936 to cover his Megow Fokker Triplane.
