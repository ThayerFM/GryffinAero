<p>Here is a nice little triplane with it's creator, fellow <a href=../../contacts/mac1.html>Marin Aero Club (MAC)</a> member Bill Hurley. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to see it.  click the image for Bill's comments and a larger image.

<p>These three pix showcase the Zephyr canard.  Originally published in the March 1979 issue of Model Builder, it is a simple rubber powered model designed by Randy and Irene Wrisley. Indoors and out, it is a great performer.  

<p>Bill has also sent me <A HREF="arado.html">a few pix of his really nice Dime Scale German Arado fighter</A>

<p>Hi Thayer,

<p>We just took a trip around our portion of your gallery. Great reproductions!

<p>In case you are wondering who "We" is,... It me and Daddy (we'll send you a <A HREF="bbc.html">picture-complete with airplane</A>- only 10 to 15 years out of date but who's counting. How 'bout 1981?). I am Bri (pronounced Bree), his youngest daughter.

<p>We enjoyed your site as usual. Keep up the good work!!! 

<p>Us
