This beautiful 30" span T-6 was built from the Herr Engineering laser kit.  The weight is 73 grams with landing gear. As can happen, it got extensively modified.
<p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The wing is removable for transportation and storage.
<p><li>
The landing gear plugs in, and is sprung to absorb landing shock.  Jerry usually flys it without the landing gear, as the drag causes a lot of duration robbing nose down trim.
<p><li>
The rudder was reshaped as per the earlier T-6 variants. 
<p><li>
Adjustable trim tabs for rudder and elevator were added.
<p><li>
The 10 gram stock canopy was cut down to just the windshield and frame.  Side windows were reglazed with florist's cellophane.
<p><li>
Due to the radial engine design, Jerry extended the nose 3/4" for better balance.
<p><li>
A larger nose block to allow more rubber clearance.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Due to the smallish MAC field, Jerry tries to hold flight times under a minute, with moderate winds on 4 strands of .20" Tan II. It is great to watch the sun streaming through the yellow covering on a clear day.
