This delightful model is an original design by Jason McGuire.
<p>
The model was originally built for rubber power from little more than a sketch.  It has since been repowered with a Hi-Line Micro-4 motor.
<p>
Despite being a great flier, the model seems to know just when it is time to quit.  It has repeatedly jumped out of rising air when threatened with leaving the field.
<p>
The answer to the inevitable question, is no. There are not yet plans available for this design.  I am pestering Jason for them, and will make them available on my site as soon as possible. Please be patient though.  A new baby and other models to build often take precedence over drafting finished plans.  For now, enjoy these photos.
