We must give credit where credit is due!  The model on top/in back was built by John Carlson, the other two were built by George Benson.
<p>
Of note, though hard to see, is that George's large red and black model has some rather fancy markings photocopied onto the tissue.  Both fins sport a line drawing of Garfield, and the top of the wing adds the title "Mouser" as well. Yeah, the tail is warped, likely due to improper storage.
<p>
George's blue model in the foreground is a reduced size Pussycat, built to a wingspan of 8".  Even at this size, the design holds up and flies extremely well.
