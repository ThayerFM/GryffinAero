<br>This is of Jerry Long with his Air Hog.  A compressed air powered model available at many toy stores, it is a great model with surprisingly good performance, despite not much of a glide.  This picture was taken right after the longest flight of the day, a staggering 56 seconds.  While this may not seem like much, most flights were right around 30 seconds.  Somehow Jerry hooked some good air, and didn't spiral in.  I lost both wings due to the dreaded spiral dive DT.

<blockquote>In the <A HREF="../../../ffml%20info/ffml.html">FFML</A> Summer of 1998 Air Hog Postal Contest, this flight ended up second only to Al Lidberg's 59 second flight in an Arizona trash moving thermal. Congrats, Jerry.</TD>
