Unfortunately, I didn't plan well enough when building this model.  My digital camera does not focus properly when photographing a model this small!  For reference, that is a US quarter next to the framework.  I apologize for the quality of the pix.
<p>
The Quad looks a bit silly with just the lower wing mounted. All together it is a lot more satisfying and just waiting for me to put down the camera, and pick out some colors!!

My model was finished with JCI Green and Silver tissue.  I presrunk the tissue without a frame, then ironed it flat once it had dried.  It was attached to the structure with a UHU brand purple glue stick.  As can be seen on the <A HREF="quads.html">previous page</A>, it sports a 3" carved balsa propeller. This was my first venture into the prop carving ring, and I have David Dodge's <A HREF="../../../tips/propcarve.html">prop carving instructions</A> to thank for my success.
