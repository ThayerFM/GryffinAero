Here George Benson demonstrates a most demanding skill; winding a fine scale model while answering questions!
<p>
The model is a 1912 Drzewiecki-Canard, built from Beno Sabel plans available from <A HREF="http://www.peck-polymers.com/" target="new">Peck Polymers</A>.  This example is a fine vintage flyer and consistently silences the attending crowds.
<p>
George is a prolific builder, and the other fine models in the foreground were only a sampling of the aircraft he brought on this particular day.
<p>
As you can see below, launching a pusher demands a bit of attention to avoid the bite of the propellor.
