<P>Marin Aero Club often will contest a "Target Time" contest.  The rules are simple.  After trimming your model, declare a specific target time over 20 seconds.  Then commence with 3 official flights, recording each flight's time on the timing sheet.  Whoever has the least total deviation from their target time is declared the winner.

<P>This format is a great equalizer in that consistency is the key, not outright duration.  It also allows models that might be a bit heavy to go head to head with, and often beat, their lighter cousins.  In 1997 this contest was won with a total error of 1 second over 3 flights.  A declared time of 25 seconds was flown with times of 25, 26, 25.  Truly an amazing performance.  The model?  A 'stock from the box' EasyBuilt Stinson Reliant Peanut.
