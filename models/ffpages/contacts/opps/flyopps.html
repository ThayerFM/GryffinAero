<B>FOURTH ANNUAL EMPIRE STATE INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS MAY 12, 2001</B>
<p>
The Western New York Free Flight Society and the Flying Aces Club will again jointly sponsor the fourth annual Empire State Indoor Championships on Saturday, May 12, at the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Fieldhouse near Orchard Park, New York. This AMA sanctioned contest will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Trophies will be awarded through third place in all events.
<p>
The contest site is the indoor practice facility of the Buffalo Bills NFL football club. Its floor measures 200 x 400 feet and is carpeted with artificial turf. The arched ceiling peaks at 128 feet, making this a premiere indoor contest site.
<p>
There will be 13 AMA and Flying Aces events, as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>AMA:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Easy B
<li>Mini Stick
<li>Limited Penny Plane
<li>7-gram Bostonian Cabin
<li>Standard Class Catapult Glider
</ol>
<p>
<li>FAC:
<br>
<ol>
<li>FAC Scale
<li>Power Scale
<li>No-Cal Scale (6.2 gram minimum weight)
<li>FAC Peanut Scale
<li>Dime Scale
<li>World War II mass launch
<li>Thompson/Greve combined mass launch
<li>Golden Age Scale
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, there will be three special events:
<p>
<ol>
<li>WNYFFS Electric Endurance.
<p>
The premise of this event is to keep things fun and low tech. The Contest Director's decision will be final regarding whether or not a given model complies with this premise and the rules.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Any free flight model powered by an electric motor is eligible to compete.
<li>
The model's airborne battery pack will be limited to two (2) nickel cadmium cells, each no larger than 50mah capacity. No method of in-flight recharging, such as the use of solar cells, is permitted.
<li>
No other electronic or mechanical devices will be allowed other than a gearbox on the motor, a charging jack, and an on/off motor switch. These devices are strictly optional.
<li>
Only a single, fixed-pitch, fixed diameter, two-bladed propeller can be used.
<li>
All pertinent AMA rules covering indoor rubber endurance will apply. Per these rules, scoring will be the highest single time of five official flights. Flights of 60 seconds or longer will be considered official.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Butterfly Duration. This event will be run by John Clapp of FAI Model Supply and uses the ready-to-fly Butterfly indoor rubber model. See details below.
<p>
<li>Science Olympiad "Wright Stuff"
<p>
New this year, this event will give middle and high school Wright Stuff fliers an opportunity to compete in a premiere flying site. Official Science Olympiad rules will be used, with two categories: Middle School and High School. There will be a $5.00 entry fee which will include mandatory AMA membership.
</ol>
<p>
Entry fee is $25 and will allow flying in all AMA, FAC, and Electric Endurance events. Wright Stuff and Butterfly events have separate entry fees.
<p>
AMA membership is required for all events, and can be obtained on site.
<p>
No food, drink, or glass containers are allowed in the building. A concession stand will be available on site for food and beverages. Ample parking is available directly in front of the main fieldhouse entrance. Helium will be provided.
<p>
FAI Model Supply is again sponsoring a special, separate event for the ready-to-fly "Butterfly" indoor rubber model. This is a mini-stick size tissue covered indoor rubber model that's literally ready to fly right out of its box. Hand made in the Czech Republic, it's easily capable of flights of two minutes or more.
<p>
Models and winders for this event will be for sale at the contest as a package and at a special reduced price. There will be three age categories: 10 years and under; 11-17, and 18 and older. A $5.00 entry fee for the first two groups includes an AMA membership. Open fliers (18 and older) must already be AMA members or be willing to join on site. This event is primarily intended to give newcomers/spectators an opportunity to give indoor rubber model flying a try. FAI Model Supply personnel will furnish assistance where needed.
<p>
Trophies will be awarded through third place in all three age groups. AMA indoor rubber rules will apply.
