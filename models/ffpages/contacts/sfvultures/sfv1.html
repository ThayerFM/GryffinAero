The San Francisco Vultures Model Airplane Club was formed in 1939 as John Pond and a few friends grew dissatisfied with the National Junior Birdmen organization and their local chapters.

Today, as one of the oldest Bay Area model flying clubs, the SF Vultures are still going strong, with members flying every weekend at a number of local sites.  We also maintain status as a chartered club of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, the U.S. national organizing body for model aviation enthusiasts.
<p>
Recognizing some of the confines of modern urban living, our models are usually radio controlled and electric powered.  We also fly sailplanes, both from flat fields or in the locally abundant slope lift.  Some Vultures also fly Free Flight, with outdoor adventures alongside the radio models.  Indoor flying is also enjoyed with modelers from other local groups like the Oakland Cloud Dusters and the <A HREF="../mac/mac1.html">Marin Aero Club</A>

Regular Vulture meetings are held on the 2nd Thursday of each month from 7:30pm to 9:30pm at the Randall Museum in San Francisco.
<p>
Group flying is unofficially held on weekend mornings, weather permitting, at the Roosevelt Elementary School near the Daly City/Pacifica town line. All are welcome, with encouragement and assistance gladly given.  A club glider has helped many beginners get a good start at this most wonderful pastime.
