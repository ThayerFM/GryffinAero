Hi there again from New Zealand.
<br>Some time ago you sent me drawings for a Bellanca Biplane. It's got the engine out at the moment but I just wanted to say thanks. I did in fact make the model and it takes place of pride in my workshop. Originally flew it with the weight to far back which caused some problems but that's all sorted now.
<br>Anyway, thanks very much.
<br>Cheers

<p>I've put up a little page regarding my Bellanca.

<br>
I took the Bellanca out this morning with a new set of 250NiMh batteries and had a blast. It would still ROG at 12 minutes and the heavier battery pack balanced the plane perfectly.
<br>
Excellent fun.
