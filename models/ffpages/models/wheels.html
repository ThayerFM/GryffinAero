Originally laminated balsa, the rim/tire is now a resin part, significantly lightened to reduce weight as much as possible.  This was changed in order to provide a finished part with a much smoother surface, and better detail than could be achieved with balsa.  The rest of the construction has remained the same. Aluminium for the hubs and tinted monofilament spokes, holding them all together.<TD align=center><IMG SRC="modelpix/wheels2.jpg" align=center width=400 height=300 hspace=10 vspace=5><P>Shown above are 3/4", 1 1/8", and 1 1/2" examples</TD></TR><tr><td colspan=2>Surprisingly strong, they are also extremely light weight.  Indeed, despite the better detail and painted finish, they are only slightly heavier than the previous unfinished balsa wheels.  Recent production averaged the following weights.<p><center><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TD align=right>Diameter</TD><TD align=center>3/4"</TD><TD align=center>7/8"</TD><TD align=center>1"</TD><TD align=center>1 1/8"</TD><TD align=center>1 1/4"</TD><TD align=center>1 3/8"</TD><TD align=center>1 1/2"</TD></TR><TR><TD align=right>grams/pair</TD><TD align=center>0.4</TD><TD align=center>0.6</TD><TD align=center>0.75</TD><TD align=center>1.3</TD><TD align=center>1.5</TD><TD align=center>2.2</TD><TD align=center>2.4</TD></TR></TABLE></center><p>For another view of the wheels, check out <a href=../ffgallery/rees/rees.html>Dave Rees's Plage Torpedo Monoplane</a>.  It is the first model to feature the new resin wheels in photographs.  Unfortunately, this fine model flew O.O.S. at the 1998 F.A.C. Nationals.<p>(Note that as of January 2000 I am no longer offering these wheels for sale.)</TD></TABLE><p>return to<p><A HREF=../../modelhp.html>home page</A> | <A HREF=peanuts1.html> thumbnails</A> | <A HREF="ff2/tatin/tatin.html">Tatin Aero Torpille</A><P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="55%"><p>Copyright 1998-2009, <A HREF="mailto:thayer@gryffinaero.com">Thayer Syme</a>  All rights reserved</P></center></body></html><!-- Peck Polymers has gotten behind my efforts and is carrying the wheels as part of their extensive inventory.  If you don't have a current copy of their catalog, send for it.  I am always amazed by their catalog, and continue to learn more as I read it.  Their 1998 edition is hot off the presses and chock full of goodies for Free Flight and RC modelers.  Though too late to make this catalog, Peck Polymers now has these wheels in all seven sizes.  -->
