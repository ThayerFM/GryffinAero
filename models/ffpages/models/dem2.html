<P>This model is a replica of Santos Dumont's Demoiselle, based on the Walt Mooney plans.  Flying weight is 7.8 grams with Japanese tissue and the now discontinued Brown GB-12 CO2 motor.  The rigging is all functional and adjustable for the tail surfaces as well as wing warping for lateral control.  This is my first CO2 powered model and has been an absolute delight.  There will definitely be more.  With a reasonable charge, this beauty will rise off the ground and putter about for just over a minute under the 26 foot rafters at the local school gym.  In flight, it sports a <A HREF=dempilot.html>pilot</A> made from an emptied peanut shell.
