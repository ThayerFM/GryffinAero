<p>
Periodically Dave Gee will include a "mystery model" in <i>"Safety Comes First"</i>, his bi-monthly column for the <a href="https://www.modelaircraft.org" target=ama>AMA's Model Aviation</a> magazine. It was such an offering in his October 2017 column that stumped may of his readers, myself included, with the Phantom. This all sheet model was originally designed by Arthur F. Muldoon and offered as a kit by the Aircraft Model Company of Wollaston, Massachusetts, 60 years or so ago.

<p>
After some time passed, it energized the <a href="../../lists/subscribe.html" target="ffml">Free Flight Mailing List</a> with a bit of discussion in early 2020. I thought it looked like a simple model that could be fun, and decided to build one. FFML member Gary Hinze had suggested a few changes after his build, most notably was adding camber to the wing. The curved wing should be stiffer, and more efficient than the original flat wing, so I decided to go that route.

<p>
<b><font size=+2>Shaping the Wing</font></b>
<br>
I've had a few questions about how I form the wing, and to be honest, it is almost embarrassingly easy to get the shape. The traditional technique has been to soak the wing blank in water for a while, then bind it to a form with a gauze bandage and set aside to dry overnight. While this works, it requires both a suitable form, and some patience, while you wait for it to dry. Instead, I use what I think is a faster and simpler technique.

<p>
Step one is plugging in my covering iron, set somewhere around 300 degrees. A clothes iron will work too, assuming domestic approval for its use. Next I hold the wing blank under a sink faucet for a couple of seconds, and let the water run over the upper side of the wing only. I'm not trying to saturate the wood, just to get some water onto the surface. I then blot it quickly with a paper towel to remove the excess water. The goal is not to dry the wood completely, just to get rid of most of the water.

<p>
You should be able to see the wing blank starting to arc across the chord as the remaining water absorbs into the wood and the surface fibers expand. I lay the wet blank over a piece of 1/8 or 3/16 square balsa at about the wing high point, and with a bit of gentle persuasion press the leading and trailing edges down to my workbench to approximate the desired curve.

<p>
Now I lightly iron the damp wing blank. Yes, it will steam and hiss as the iron drys it out, and that is the "secret" to my technique. The steam softens the wood as the drying action sets the curve. This goes really quickly, and typically takes much less time than it took to write this description. If you decide you want to rework the curve a bit, just go back to the sink, get it wet and steam it again.

<p>
<b><font size=+2>Fuselage Assembly</font></b>
<br>
The rest of the build is quite straight forward. The fuselage is a basic box with just two formers. I glue the formers to one of the fuselage sizes first, flush to the top of the side. I also etched lines onto the sides to help locate the formers. Once the formers are on one side, then I join the second side with the fuselage assembly upside down on a flat surface. The belly sheeting fits between the fuselage sides, and 
and the nose block 

Our updated kit features precision laser cut parts from hand-selected contest balsa. We recommend the 7-inch silver prop, nose bushing and prop shafts available in the Peck Polymers <font color=blue><u><a href="https://www.wind-it-up.com/collections/miscellaneous-must-haves/products/pa003" target="pecks">Medium Designers Kit</u></font></a>. A loop of 1/8 rubber is good for smaller fields or flying indoors, while a loop of 3/16 will give your Phantom a more rapid climb.
