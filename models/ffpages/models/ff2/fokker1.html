The model is finished as a Jasta 9 machine, it has been a bit troublesome in the air.  Initially I was scared to really give it the power it seemed to need.</td></tr>

<tr><td>More recently, I have added some ballast to get the CG well forward, and upped the rubber size as well.  It is now flying in a stable right circle, for a bit over 30 seconds.
