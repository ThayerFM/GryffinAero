<TD>The picture shows the simple pull - pull ruder control I rigged up.  A nylon 2-56 bolt is threaded into a scrap of inner nyrod that was tapped using a 2-56 tap.  The thread was secured to the bolt through a small hole and knotted.  A few opposing wraps were made around the bolt, and the thread secured to the 1/64" ply control horn.
<p>
It was a bit more work than just using bits of wire to hinge the rudder, but I believe that the control will be easier to adjust, and be more stable as well. Yes it does bind a bit as I adjust the rudder to one side or the other, but I see this as a good thing.  It should help hold the adjustment.</TD>
