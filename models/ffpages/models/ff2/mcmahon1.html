<TD>This "peanut scale" 1920 McMahon Biplane was built from Jim Algar plans.  A scale powerplant would be a V-twin motorcycle engine, but I had this Brown GB-24 Twin CO2 motor and couldn't resist!  The engine is easily removeable if I decide to fly with rubber power someday.

<TD>Unfortunately, little is known about the original aircraft.  Of course this does provide unprecidented leeway for a scale model, allowing the individual modeler to choose a color scheme that is not dictated.  The model is finished with japanese tissue throughout.  JCI Blue and Silver on the fuselage, and Micro-X Old Timer for the flying surfaces.  Is it scale?  Most likely not, but it is pleasing to my eye, and doesn't that count from something?

<td>The wings have scale spaced ribs with thread to simulate the original wire trailing edges.  Finished weight of the model is just over 17 grams including aluminium tubing axles, <A HREF="../wheels.html">spoked wheels</A> and the 6 grams of CO2 motor, prop and tank.  Fortunately the wings are large!</td>

Now if only I can make it through the trimming stages before destroying it!

<table width=440>
<tr><td><B>11/18/98:</B> Last weekend the model trimmed out with a lot of right thrust to fly left - left.  Top time was 38 seconds, with most around 25 or so.  Great fun to watch it flit about.
