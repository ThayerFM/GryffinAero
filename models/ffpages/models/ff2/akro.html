<P>This delightful model is one of a long line of designs from the drawingboard of Dick Baxter.  Named the Akro, it was originally designed as a 16" span model.  This version was built to a span of 8", merely by reducing the plans on a photocopier, and halfing all the wood dimensions.  This model weighs almost nothing, and flies forever.  Build one now!!
