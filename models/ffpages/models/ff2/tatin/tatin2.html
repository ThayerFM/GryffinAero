Progress? ... well not yet.  I spent a few days looking at the drawings, and thinking about how I might start.
<p>
Finally, I "averaged" the info at hand, and started in on the framework at a wingspan of 19 3/4".  Much of the time was spent figuring out how to make the components, and making jigs for them.
<p>
Construction of the fuselage was of conventional keel and former technique.  the spars were laminated on a curved form, later used for final assembly of the wings.  The leading and trailing edges were laminated in place, once the ribs were on the spars.
<p>
Shown are the beginnings of the model.
<br>LOA will be about 19" plus prop and spinner
<p>Wing area - 64 sq in
<p>
After 12 hours, the fuse and wings were pretty much complete.
<p>
fuse  - 5.8 grams
<br>wing panels - 4.7 grams
<p>
7 hours later had the tail surfaces, landing gear, nose cone, and tail skid adding more weight.
<P>stab - 1.0 grams
<br>rudder - 0.6 grams
