<P>If you want fun and excitement in a novel Free Flight model, you have got to have one of these helicopters!  

<P>I built this one straight from the Penni kit available from Peck Polymers.  All of the tricky stuff is preshaped, and the kit goes together very easily in just a few hours.  

<P>In flight it is very stable, circling to the right, in a slowly drifting hover.  It doesn't need any more space than a standard school gym, and has been flown in sites ranging from an average sized living room to the Makon Airship Hangar at <A HREF=../../moffett/moffett2.html>Moffett Field</A>.  Times over 35 seconds indoors, and over 50 seconds outside, have been regularly witnessed.

<P>This model has proven so popular that there are now 4 flying in my local club, with at least one or two more on the way.  Mass launches are a ball.  Don't delay, get your's now!!
