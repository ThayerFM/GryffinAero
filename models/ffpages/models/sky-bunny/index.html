The Sky Bunny is a Bill Warner design, intended as a second or third step for budding modelers. It has long been available as a kit from <a href="http://www.peck-polymers.com/" target="new">Peck-Polymers</a> and remains popular with beginners and more experienced modelers alike. Its basic construction and proven flight characteristics make this model a quick build and relaxing sport flyer for all.
<p> Inspired by the <a href="http://www.endlesslift.com/second-international-sky-bunny-postal-contest" target="new">Second International Sky Bunny Postal Contest</a> held over Labor Day Weekend, Gryffin and I decided to build a couple of models to enter. Like the <a href=../prairie-bird/index.html>Prairie Birds</a> we built over the summer, he worked with a laser cut kit from Peck-Polymers while I built mine from plans.
