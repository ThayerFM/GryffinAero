<p>
This is a preliminary page to park some progress photos and a few thoughts about my latest Free Flight project, the Heinkel He.18. This rubber-powered model will have a 54-inch wing span, and is based on a much smaller electric design by Hurst Bowers, published years ago in Model Aviation.
<p>
The He.18 was introduced in Germany in 1925 for sport flying and flight school use. The fuselage structure was welded from steel tube, though a wood version was also available for those without local access to skilled metal workers for maintenance. Wings were wood construction, and folded along the fuselage for storage in a small garage. It could be towed to the owner's home with his automobile, or even a motorcycle.
<p>
The full scale version was powered with a 50 or 75 hp Siemens radial engine, depending on your budget, and could be fitted with either wheels or floats.
