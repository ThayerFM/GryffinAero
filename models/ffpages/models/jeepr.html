<P>This sporty green and yellow model is from the EasyBuilt kit for the Art Chester 1930's Racer.  Other than the fin and rudder outline, it is pretty close to AC's Jeep Racer, so I decorated it as campaigned in it's first racing season, 1937.  All markings are laser printed onto preshrunk Japanese tissue.  Balanced and ready to fly weight is 9.7 gms without rubber.  Flying times so far are around 35 seconds under the same rafters the Demoiselle dodges.
