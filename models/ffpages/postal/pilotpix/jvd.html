Here's my first peanut.  It's 95% done,  still needs those long struts, prop assembly, headrest.  I just got the stuctures together a few minutes ago and had to send in a pic.  Thanks to a major blizzard which restricted everyone to home since Sat. morning I was able to get as far as I did.  I hope to fly it this Friday.  (glides across livingroom--kitchen pretty nice!  about 2 seconds!)

I was able to "finish" my Andreason this weekend as the great blizzard of '99 had every one in West Michigan staying inside for a few days.
