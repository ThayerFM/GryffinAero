Notes:
<p>Model completed this morning. 
Weight is 12.5 grams,  Flown at Oxbow Rec. Center in Seattle.  Was safe of the board.
<p>
Flying site was very cold. lots of broken motors and not much flight time.
<p>
Pic attached is not very good as it was taken wilth a Polaroid. Will have a better one by next month.
<p>
Notes:<br>
Had more time to trim today (1/16/99) so had better times. At 12.5 grams I don't think I will get more time at this site. It sure is fun to see it skim the rafters at 25'.
<p>
Maybe at the Kibby Dome it will do better.
