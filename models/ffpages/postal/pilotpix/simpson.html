Above is a picture of my Andreason.  I have since changed to a 6" Peck prop, but have not flown it yet in that configuration.  I will E-Mail you the times when I do so.  I have flown it in Durham, Ct on December 5th but was not happy with the the flight duration. (didn't time it).  It spiralled in when the motor stopped.  I threw in a pic of it flying on Dec 5th.  Both Bob Thompson and David Stott, Peanut scale founders, were there to witness the flights.
