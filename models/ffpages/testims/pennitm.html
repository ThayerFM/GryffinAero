I recently bought a Penni kit from PP for about $22.  At first I thought  "jeez, that's pretty expensive".  However, after the kit arrived, I changed  my mind.  The kit is extensively pre-fabricated which accounts for a lot of the cost.
I haven't started building it yet, but so far I'm pretty happy with it.
It seems that decent kits are pretty expensive these days.
<p>
For those of you who like to scratch build this stuff, I recently discovered (after I bought the kit of course :-)) that the plans for the Penni were published in American Aircraft Modeller magazine.  I don't remember the exact month off hand, but it was in early 1970.

Jeremy and others,
<P>
There are currently four participants in our Penni Helicopter Free Flight
Modeling Workshop. We have received the kits from Peck Polymers but have not started yet as most of us are working on the Frontroom Flyable's Ornithopter. Steve Price in Canada has built a Penni and I posted some of his tips on the <a href="http://members.aol.com/FFMYHOBBY/home.htm">Free Flight Modeling Workshop Web Site.</a>
<p>
If you go for the Penni I welcome you to be a virtual participant in the Penni
workshop. The local participants build at lunch time so we take a while to do
a workshop, however the workshops are self paced!

The Penni copter is WELL worth the money.  Mine built easily, and flew right off the board. I have since taken the  original design, and scratch build 3 more copters. Mainly different sizes  than the Penni.
<p>
Have fun with this aspect of FF modeling. It is challenging and rewarding.
