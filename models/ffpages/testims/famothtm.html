<br>Subject: Flying Aces Moth - Specifications, etc.
<p>
Available as a kit from Peck-Polymers  PP031 about $11
<br>Plans from John Pond - 40B5  $4
<br>Plans from AeroDyne (Old Time Model Supply) Nr. 500 $3.50
<p>
The wing span is 24 inches.  It is a small cabin long nose design from 1937.
<p>
Things to watch on the plans when you build one.  I used the Peck-Polymer plans (kit).
<p>
Fuselage Ref. Line   0 degrees
<br>Main wing cord is also 0 degrees
<br>tail is also 0 degrees.
<p>
The thrust angle is between 2 and 3 degrees negative.  Watch the rear peg it is high not centered.  Also the nose block is not vertical, but angled about 2 degrees negative
<p>
The airfoil is about 8 % flat bottom.  Airfoil is not on the plans the other formed parts are there.  
<p>
Shorten the nose about  1 1/4 " for plastic prop.  It works great orginial length with balsa prop.
<p>
When you get the thrust line and incidence correct you get a nice steady climb under power and a long flat glide with free wheeling prop.
<p>
Most of the construction is 3/32 sticks.  
<p>
This one will fly away with good thermals.   So should add a DT.
<p>
Bill Warner book "Flying Aces Moth" ISBN 0-8306-2510-0 tells how to do the DT a couple of ways and also about short nose.

Also, the wing incidence or rather the decalage on the Peck plans is all wrong. If you carefully measure, they are set up zero-zero.  With about 3 degrees positive in the wing, which is nearly the same as extending the upper longerons forward to the windshield posts, the published balance point of 50% is bang on.  I agree with Thayer's comments as to the effect of the plastic prop.  Since I plan to carve a prop, I used the plastic one for now, and added a bit of weight to the tail which I will remove upon installation of the plastic prop.  BTW, it flies so well that a DT is essential. One of the grey DT timers that Al sells at Aerodyne works really well, and is easier to set up than a fuse.

Hi:
<br>Stupid me.  The first time I built an FA moth, I did not understand it was an OT cabin.  Aeromodeller of England published the plans.  I just assumed it to be another sport plane. Mine needed a  3/32 shim under the leading edge.   And I built the tail feathers too heavy, so I needed that heavy plastic prop!  I was surprised when the guys in the club asked if I built it for Old Timer Cabin....of course with a shortened nose it would not have been legal.

Everyone should build this one.  It is great and one of the few that I think was really engineered.  
<p>
I first used the plastic prop and then finally carve my first wood prop.
<p>
Watch your wing set up and thrust line.  Get it right and it climbs under power and then gives a really nice long duration glide.
<p>
With the long nose even looks great sitting on the shelf.  Easy to build, kit is cheap ($11) and once you get a set of plans you can build a couple more for pennies.  It looks great in just about any color.  Make the wings and body different colors.  
<p>
If you can find one, the "Bill Warner" book on building the moth has a lot of good tips.
