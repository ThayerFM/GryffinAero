<h2 align = center>Thoughts from Dan O'Grady</h2>

<p><hr size=2 width="75%">

<p>Here is some background information on balsa stiffness testing: The Euler method for calculating balsa stiffness and density was first described by Hewitt Phillips in an article in the NFFS Digest in May, 1987.

<p>The method has been used by Jack McGillivray since that time, and I have used it for about 5 years. Fairly recently Jack has simplified the calculations with the use of a programmable Casio calculator. The Euler method, and Jack's calculator program for the method were fully described in an article by Jack in the Jan 1997 issue of'SAM 86 Speaks' - editor Dan O'Grady.

<p>In Jan 1997 John Barker presented a paper at the British Model Flying Association (BFMA) Free Flight Forum at London, England, on balsa quality and testing. This paper was co-authored by Bernard Hunt and John Taylor and described a measurement method for determining balsa stiffness (Youngs modulus) by measuring deflection caused by loading a balsa sheet with a weight.

<p>This 1997 paper (subsequently published in the Feb 1997 issue of the English indoor newsletter 'Norwind News') was the fourth in a series of papers on the measurement of stiffness using a defection/weight system and is the culmination of their experience to that date. 

<p>A similar system for measuring Youngs modulus was described by Joe Maxwell (the Scottish custom balsa component supplier) in the European indoor newsletter'Indoor News' in their Nov 1995 issue. 

<p>The Hunt/Taylor method is innovative in that the authors develop a 'stiffness coefficient' as a standard against which to evaluate samples irrespective of their density. The method requires the fabrication of jigs and weights and the measurement process is more involved than the Euler method.

<p>In either method, if a lot of measurements are to be made the calculations can be quite tedious, and a programmable calculator or a computer is highly desirable.

<p>Although I've seen Bernie's papers on the deflection/weight method of stiffness testing, I haven't seen his paper on the Euler method in any of the modeling literature. I look forward to seeing any developments or improvements of the method originally described in the a/n NFFS Digest (1987) and SAM 86 Speaks (1997).
