<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Finding the Mean Aerodynamic Chord</H1>
<P><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="75%">

<P>Numerous new models have met an unnecessary, and untimely, end due to the builders not determining the center of gravity <CG> before the initial flights.  A plane that is improperly balanced can be so unstable as to defeat any and all efforts to make it behave.

<P>The usual trick of starting with the CG at 25% of the chord of the wing works fine, when the wing is straight and untapered.  Troubles arise as soon as taper and sweep rear their ugly heads.  25% is still a good starting point, but 25% of what?  The Mean Aerodynamic Chord allows us to determine the CG as if the wing were straight and untapered.  Placing the CG at 25% of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord will be much more successful for initial flights than just guessing.
<P>As is often quoted, a picture is worth a thousand words.  This diagram should be self explainatory with a bit of study.
