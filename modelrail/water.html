These cute little water cars come as a cast resin kit. This first shot shows them after a good cleaning and lightly primed in black. I also used acrylic craft paints to give a "weathered wood" base on the decks.</td></tr>

I started with a base of black primer, then cut vinyl masks and lightly dabbed paint through them for the markings. I didn't need complete coverage with the white, as  the inconsistencies would blend nicely with the weathering. I also really like the texture of the castings, as it lends itself to a rustic look.

Partially weathered tanks. I used a combination of Bragdon powders applied dry and with alcohol, as well as acrylic craft paints. As you can see, I ultimately added more color and backed off the rust on #7 a bit.

Figuring that it wasn't uncommon 125 years ago to find illiterate men working on the railroad and in the logging camps and quarries they served, I decided top brass had the tanks color-coded with blue bands top and bottom to signify potable water. Unfortunately the paint they used doesn't hold up well to the abuse out on the road.

Like any kit build, I added a little personalization with turned brass valve fittings, hoses of solder, and .020 brass wire handles on the tank lids. The final detail I added was some blocking with NBWs to keep the tanks from "walking" off the decks on rough track. I also hollowed the tanks a little and added some brass slugs to boost their weight. I don't know if it was necessary. The Kadee #5 couplers and BVM T-1 trucks are as recommended by BVM.</td>

Unfortunately, this kit is no longer available. Boulder Valley Models closed not long after I bought mine.
